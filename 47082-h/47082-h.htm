The good assurance of your
native worth, and thrice generous
disposition, as also the
continuall manifestation of
your bounteous favour, and
love towards my selfe in particular,
hath so bound my
thankfull acknowledgement,
that I count it the least part
of my service to present the first fruites of my farre-fetcht
experience, to the kinde acceptance of your
charitable hands: well knowing that though this
my worke, owne not worth enough to deserve your
patronage, yet such is your benigne humanity, that I
am confident you will daigne it your protection, under
which it willingly shrowdes it selfe. And as it is
reported of that man whose name was <i>Alexander</i>,
being a cowardly milke-sop by nature, yet hearing
of the valiant courage of that magnificent <i>Hero</i>,
<i>Alexander</i> the Great, whose name hee bore, he
thenceforth became stout and valorous; and as he
was animated by having the very name of puissant
<i>Alexander</i>; so shall these my weake and feble labours,
receive life and courage by the patronage of
your much esteemed selfe; whereby they shall bee
able to out-face the keenest fanges of a blacke
mouth'd <i>Momus</i>. For from hence the world may
conclude, that either there was some worth in the
booke, that caused so wise a person to looke upon it,
and to vouchsafe to owne it, or else if they suppose
that in charity he fosterd it, as being a poore helpelesse
brat, they may thence learne to do so likewise.
If here I should take upon me the usuall straine of a
soothing Epistolizer, I should (though upon better
grounds than many) sound forth a full mouth'd encomiasticke
of your incomparable worth: but
though your deserts may justly challenge it, yet I
know your vertuous modesty would not thanke me
for it; and indeed your owne actions are the best
<i>Heralds</i> of your owne praise, which in spite of envy
it selfe must speake you Wise, and truly Noble:
and I for my part, if I may but present any thing,
which either for its profit or delight may obtaine
your favourable approbation, I have already reaped
the harvest of my expectation; onely I must
desire you to pardon my bold presumption, as thus
to make your well deserving name, the frontispeece
to so rude and ill deserving frame. Thus wishing a
confluence of all blessings both of the throne, and
foot-stoole, to be multiplied upon your selfe, and
your vertuous Consort, my very good Lady, together
with all the Stemmes of your Noble family, I
take my leave and rest,</p>

<i>Though I will promise thee no such
voluminous discourse, as many have
made upon a scanter subject, (though
they have travailed no further than
the smoake of their owne native
chimnies) yet dare I presume to present
thee with the true, and faithfull
relation of some few yeares travels and experience,
wherein I would be loath to broach any thing which
may puzzle thy beleefe, and so justly draw upon my
selfe, that unjust aspersion commonly laid on travailers;
of whom many say, They may lye by authority, because
none can controule them; which Proverbe had
surely his originall from the sleepy beleefe of many a
home-bred Dormouse, who comprehends not either the
raritie or possibility of those things he sees not, to
whom the most classicke relations seeme riddles, and
paradoxes: of whom it may be said as once of </i>Diogenes<i>,
that because he circled himselfe in the circumference
of a tubbe, he therefore contemned the Port and
Pallace of </i>Alexander<i>, which he knew not. So there is
many a tub-brain'd Cynicke, who because any thing
stranger than ordinary, is too large for the straite
hoopes of his apprehension, he peremptorily concludes it
is a lye: But I decline this sort of thicke-witted readers,
and dedicate the mite of my endeavours to my
more credulous, ingenious, and lesse censorious Country-men,
for whose sake I undertooke this worke; and
I did it the rather, because there hath some relations
heretofore past the Presse, which have beene very imperfect;
as also because there hath beene many scandalous
and false reports past upon the Country, even from
the sulphurious breath of every base ballad-monger:
wherefore to perfect the one, and take off the other, I
have laid downe the nature of the Country, without any
partiall respect unto it, as being my dwelling place
where I have lived these foure yeares, and intend God
willing to returne shortly againe; but my conscience is
to me a thousand witnesses, that what I speake is the very
truth, and this will informe thee almost as fully concerning
it, as if thou wentest over to see it. Now whereas
I have written the latter part of this relation concerning
the </i>Indians<i>, in a more light and facetious stile,
than the former; because their carriage and behaviour
hath afforded more matter of mirth, and laughter, than
gravity and wisedome; and therefore I have inserted
many passages of mirth concerning them, to spice the
rest of my more serious discourse, and to make it more
pleasant. Thus thou mayest in two or three houres travaile
over a few leaves, see and know that, which cost
him that writ it, yeares and travaile, over Sea and
Land before he knew it; and therefore I hope thou wilt
accept it; which shall be my full reward, as it was my
whole ambition, and so I rest,</i></p>

For as much as the Kings most excellent Majesty
hath beene graciously pleasd by the grant of his
Letters Patents, at first to give life to the
plantations of <i>New England</i>, and hath dayly
likewise by his Favours and Royall protection
cherished their growing hopes; whereby many of his Majesties
faithfull Subjects haue beene imboldned to venture persons,
states, and indeavours, to the inlargement of his Dominions
in that Westerne Continent: Wherefore I thought fit
(for the further encouragement of those that hereafter, either
by Purse, or Person shall helpe forward the Plantation,) to
set forth these few observations out of my personall and experimentall
knowledge.</p>

<p class='c005'>The place whereon the <i>English</i> have built their Colonies,
is judged by those who have best skill in discovery, either to
<span class='pageno' title='2' id='Page_2'></span>be an Iland, surrounded on the North side with the spacious
River <i>Cannada</i>, and on the South with <i>Hudsons</i> River, or
else a <i>Peninsula</i>, these two Rivers overlapping one another,
having their rise from the great Lakes which are not farre off
one another, as the <i>Indians</i> doe certainely informe us. But
it is not my intent to wander far from our Patent; wherefore
I referre you to the thrice memorable discoverer of those parts,
Captaine <i>Smith</i>, who hath likewise fully described the Southerne
and North-east part of <i>New England</i>, with the noted
head-lands, Capes, Harbours, Rivers, Ponds, and Lakes,
with the nature of the Soyle, and commodities both by Sea
and Land, &amp;c. within the degrees of fourty one and fourty
five.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Bay of <i>Massachusets</i> lyeth under the degree of fourty
two and fourty three, bearing South-west from the Lands
end of <i>England</i>: at the bottome whereof are situated most
of the <i>English</i> plantations: This Bay is both safe, spacious,
and deepe, free from such cockling Seas as runne upon the
Coast of <i>Ireland</i>, and in the Channels of <i>England</i>: there
be no stiffe running Currents, or Rockes, Shelves, Barres,
Quicksands. The Mariners having sayled two or three
Leagues towards the bottome, may behold the two Capes
embracing their welcome Ships in their Armes, which thrust
themselves out into the Sea in forme of a halfe-moone, the
surrounding shore being high, and shewing many white
Cliffes in a most pleasant prospect with divers places of low
land, out of which divers Riuers vent themselves into the
Ocean, with many openings, where is good Harbouring for
Ships of any burthen; so that if an unexpected storme or crosse
winde should barre the Marriner from recovering his desired
Port, he may reach other Harbours, as <i>Plimmouth</i>, <i>Cape
Ann</i>, <i>Salem</i>, <i>Marvill Head</i>; all which afford good ground
for Anchorage, being likewise land-lockt from Winde and
Seas. The chiefe and usuall Harbour, is the still Bay of <i>Massachusets</i>,
which is close aboard the plantations, in which
most of our ships come to anchor, being the nearest their mart,
and usuall place of landing of Passengers; it is a safe and pleasant
Harbour within, having but one common and safe
<span class='pageno' title='3' id='Page_3'></span>entrance, and that not very broad, there scarce being roome
for 3. Ships to come in board and board at a time, but
being once within, there is roome for the Anchorage of 500.
Ships.</p>

<p class='c005'>This Harbour is made by a great company of Ilands, whose
high Cliffes shoulder out the boistrous Seas, yet may easily
deceiue any unskilfull Pilote; presenting many faire openings
and broad sounds, which afford too shallow waters for any
Ships, though navigable for Boates and small pinnaces. The
entrance into the great Haven is called <i>Nantascot</i>; which is
two Leagues from <i>Boston</i>; this place of it selfe is a very good
Haven, where Ships commonly cast Anchor, untill Winde
and Tyde serve them for other places; from hence they may
sayle to the River of <i>Wessaguscus</i>, <i>Naponset</i>, <i>Charles</i> River,
and <i>Misticke</i> River, on which Rivers bee seated many
Townes. In any of these fore-named harbours, the Sea-men
having spent their old store of Wood and Water, may haue
fresh supplies from the adjacent Ilands, with good timber to
repaire their weather-beaten Ships: Here likewise may be had
Masts or Yards, being store of such Trees as are usefull for the
same purpose.</p>

<div class="sh">
<i>Of the Seasons of the yeare, Winter and Summer, together
with the Heate, Cold, Snow, Raine, and the
effects of it.</i>
</div>

<p class='c014'>For that part of the Countrey wherein most of the <i>English</i>
have their habitations: it is for certaine the best ground
and sweetest Climate in all those parts, bearing the name
of <i>New England</i>, agreeing well with the temper of our
<i>English</i> bodies, being high land, and sharpe Ayre, and
though most of our <i>English</i> Townes border upon the Sea-coast,
yet are they not often troubled with Mists, or unwholesome
fogges, or cold weather from the Sea, which lies East
and South from the Land. And whereas in <i>England</i> most of
the cold windes and weathers come from the Sea, and those
<span class='pageno' title='4' id='Page_4'></span>situations are counted most unwholesome, that are neare the
Sea-coast, in that Countrey it is not so, but otherwise; for in
the extremity of Winter, the North-east and South winde
comming from the Sea, produceth warme weather, and
bringing in the warme-working waters of the Sea, loosneth
the frozen Bayes, carrying away their Ice with their Tides,
melting the Snow, and thawing the ground; onely the North-west
winde comming over the Land, is the cause of extreame
cold weather, being alwaies accompanied with deepe Snowes
and bitter Frost, so that in two or three dayes the Rivers are
passable for horse and man. But as it is an Axiome in Nature,
<i>Nullum violentum est perpetuum</i>, No extreames last
long, so this cold winde blowes seldome above three dayes
together, after which the weather is more tollerable, the
Aire being nothing so sharpe, but peradventure in foure or
five dayes after this cold messenger will blow a fresh, commanding
every man to his house, forbidding any to out-face
him without prejudice to their noses; but it may be objected
that it is too cold a Countrey for our <i>English</i> men, who have
beene accustomed to a warmer Climate, to which it may be
answered, (<i>Igne levatur hyems</i>) there is Wood good store,
and better cheape to build warme houses, and make good
fires, which makes the Winter lesse tedious: and moreover,
the extremity of this cold weather lasteth but for two Moneths
or ten weekes, beginning in <i>December</i>, and breaking up the
tenth day of <i>February</i>; which hath beene a passage very remarkeable,
that for ten or a dozen yeares the weather hath
held himselfe to his day, unlocking his ycie Bayes and Rivers,
which are never frozen againe the same yeare, except there
be some small frost untill the middle of <i>March</i>. It is observed
by the <i>Indians</i> that every tenth yeare there is little or no
Winter, which hath beene twice observed of the <i>English</i>;
the yeare of new <i>Plimouth</i> mens arrivall was no Winter in
comparison; and in the tenth yeare after likewise when the
great company settled themselves in <i>Massachusets Bay</i>, was
a very milde season, little Frost, and lesse Snow, but cleare
serene weather, few North-west windes, which was a great
mercy to the <i>English</i> comming over so rawly and uncomfortably
<span class='pageno' title='5' id='Page_5'></span>provided, wanting all utensils and provisions which belonged
to the well being of Planters: and whereas many died at
the beginning of the plantations, it was not because the Country
was unhealthfull, but because their bodies were corrupted
with sea-diet, which was naught, their Beefe and Porke being
tainted, their Butter and Cheese corrupted, their Fish rotten, &amp;
voyage long, by reason of crosse Windes, so that winter approaching
before they could get warme houses, and the searching
sharpnes of that purer Climate, creeping in at the crannies
of their crazed bodies, caused death and sicknesse; but their
harmes having taught future voyagers more wisedome, in shipping
good provision for Sea, and finding warme houses at landing,
finde health in both. It hath bin observed, that of five or
sixe hundred passengers in one yeare, not above three have died
at Sea, having their health likewise at Land. But to returne to
the matter in hand, dayly observations makes it apparant, that
the peircing cold of that Country produceth not so many noysome
effects, as the raw winters of <i>England</i>. In publike assemblies
it is strange to heare a man sneeze or cough as ordinarily
they doe in old <i>England</i>; yet not to smother any thing, lest you
judge me too partiall in reciting good of the Countrey, and not
bad; true it is, that some venturing too nakedly in extreamity
of cold, being more foole hardy than wise, have for a time
lost the use of their feete, others the use of their fingers; but
time and Surgery afterwards recovered them: Some haue had
their over-growne beards so frozen together, that they could
not get their strong water-bottells into their mouthes; I never
heard of any that utterly perished at land with cold, saving one
<i>English</i> man and an <i>Indian</i>, who going together a Fowling,
the morning being faire at their setting out, afterward a terrible
storme arising, they intended to returne home; but the
storme being in their faces, and they not able to with-stand
it, were frozen to death, the <i>Indian</i> having gained three
flight-shot more of his journey homeward, was found reared
up against a tree with his <i>Aqua-vitæ</i> bottle at his head. A second
passage (concerning which many thinke hardly of the Country
in regard of his cold) was the miscarriage of a boate at sea; certaine
men having intended a voyage to new <i>Plimouth</i>, setting
<span class='pageno' title='6' id='Page_6'></span>sayle towards night, they wanted time to fetch it, being constrained
to put into another harbour, where being negligent of
the well mooring of their Boate, a strong winde comming
from the shore in the night, loosned their killocke, and drove
them to Sea, without sight of land, before they had awaked
out of sleepe; but seeing the eminent danger, such as were not
benummed with cold, shipt out their Oares, shaping their
course for <i>Cape Cod</i>, where the <i>Indians</i> met them, who buried
the dead, and carryed the Boate with the living to <i>Plimouth</i>,
where some of them died, and some recovered. These
things may fright some, but being that there hath beene many
passages of the like nature in our <i>English</i> Climate, it cannot
dishearten such as seriously consider it, seeing likewise
that their owne ruines sprung from their owne negligence.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Countrey is not so extreamely cold, unlesse it be when
the North-west winde is high, at other times it is ordinary
for Fishermen to goe to Sea in <i>Ianuary</i> and <i>February</i>, in
which time they get more Fish, and better than in Summer,
onely observing to reach some good Harbours before night,
where by good fires they sleepe as well and quietly, (having
their mayne sayle tented at their backes, to shelter them from
the winde) as if they were at home. To relate how some
<i>English</i> bodies have borne out cold, will (it may be) startle
beliefe of some, it being so strange, yet not so strange as
true. A certaine man being something distracted, broke away
from his Keeper, and running into the Wood, could
not bee found with much seeking after; but foure dayes being
expired, he returned, to appearance as well in body, as at
his egresse, and in minde much better: for a mad man to
hit home through the unbeaten Woods, was strange, but to
liue without meate or drinke in the deepe of Winter, stranger,
and yet returne home bettered, was most strange: but if truth
may gaine beleefe, you may behold a more superlative
strangenesse. A certaine Maide in the extreamity of cold weather,
(as it fell out) tooke an uncertaine journey, in her intent
short, not above foure miles, yet long in event; for losing
her way, she wandred sixe or seaven dayes in most bitter
weather, not having one bit of bread to strengthen her, sometimes
<span class='pageno' title='7' id='Page_7'></span>a fresh Spring quenched her thirst, which was all the
refreshment she had; the Snow being upon the ground at first,
shee might have trackt her owne foot-steps backe againe, but
wanting that understanding, shee wandred, till God by his
speciall providence brought her to the place shee went from,
where she lives to this day.</p>

<p class='c005'>The hard Winters are commonly the fore-runners of pleasant
Spring-times, and fertile Summers, being iudged likewise
to make much for the health of our <i>English</i> bodies: It is found
to be more healthfull for such as shall adventure thither, to
come towards Winter, than the hot Summer; the Climate in
Winter is commonly cold and dry, the Snow lies long, which
is thought to be no small nourishing to the ground. For the
<i>Indians</i> burning it to suppresse the under-wood, which else
would grow all over the Countrey, the Snow falling not long
after, keepes the ground warme, and with his melting conveighs
the ashes into the pores of the earth, which doth fatten
it. It hath beene observed, that <i>English</i> Wheate and Rye
proves better, which is Winter sowne, and is kept warme
by the Snow, than that which is sowne in the Spring. The
Summers be hotter than in <i>England</i>; because of their more
Southerne latitude, yet are they tollerable; being often cooled
with fresh blowing windes, it seldome being so hot as men
are driven from their labours, especially such whose imployments
are within doores, or under the coole shade: servants
have hitherto beene priviledged to rest from their labours in
extreame hot weather, from ten of the clocke till two, which
they regaine by their early rising in the morning, and double diligence
in coole weather. The Summers are commonly hot
and dry, there being seldome any raines; I have knowne it
sixe or seaven weekes, before one shower hath moystened the
Plowmans labour, yet the Harvest hath beene very good, the
<i>Indian</i> Corne requiring more heate than wet; for the <i>English</i>
Corne, it is refresht with the nightly dewes, till it grow vp
to shade his roots with his owne substance from the parching
Sunne. In former times the Raine came seldome, but very violently,
continuing his drops, (which were great and many)
sometimes foure and twenty houres together; sometimes
<span class='pageno' title='8' id='Page_8'></span>eight and fourty, which watered the ground for a long
time after; but of late the Seasons be much altered, the raine
comming oftner, but more moderately, with lesse thunder and
lightnings, and suddaine gusts of winde. I dare be bold to affirme
it, that I saw not so much raine, raw colds, and misty
fogges in foure yeares in those parts, as was in <i>England</i> in the
space of foure Moneths the last Winter; yet no man at the
yeares end, complained of too much drought, or too little
raine. The times of most Raine, are in the beginning of <i>Aprill</i>,
and at <i>Michaelmas</i>. The early Springs and long Summers
make but short Autumnes and Winters. In the Spring when
the Grasse beginnes to put forth, it growes apace, so that
where it was all blacke by reason of Winters burnings, in a
fortnight there will be Grasse a foote high.</p>

<div class="sh">
<i>Of the Climate, length, and shortnesse of day and night,
with the suiteablenesse of it to English bodies for
health and sicknesse.</i>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The Countrey being nearer the Equinoctiall than
<i>England</i>, the dayes and nights be more equally divided.
In Summer the dayes be two houres shorter, and likewise
in Winter two houres longer than in <i>England</i>. In
a word, both Summer and Winter is more commended of the
<i>English</i> there, than the Summer Winters, and Winter Summers
of <i>England</i>; and who is there that could not wish, that
<i>Englands</i> Climate were as it hath beene in quondam times,
colder in Winter, and hotter in Summer? or who will condemne
that which is as <i>England</i> hath beene? <i>Virginia</i> having
no Winter to speake of, but extreame hot Summers,
hath dried up much <i>English</i> blood, and by pestiferous diseases
swept away many lusty bodies, changing their complexion
not into swarthinesse, but into Palenesse; so that when as
they come for trading into our parts, wee can know many
of them by their faces. This alteration certainely comes not
from any want of victuals or necessary foode, for their soyle is
<span class='pageno' title='9' id='Page_9'></span>very fertile and pleasant, yeelding both Corne and Cattle
plenty, but rather from the Climate, which indeede is found to
be hotter than is suiteable to an ordinary <i>English</i> constitution.</p>

<p class='c005'>In <i>New England</i> both men and women keepe their naturall
complexions, in so much as Sea men wonder when they
arrive in those parts, to see their Countrey-men so fresh and
ruddy: If the Sunne doth tanne any, yet the Winters cold
restores them to their former complexion; and as it is for the
outward complexion, so it is for the inward constitution; not
very many being troubled with inflammations, or such diseases
as are encreased by too much heate: and whereas I say, not
very many, yet dare I not exclude any; for death being certaine
to all, in all Nations there must be something tending to
death of like certainty. The soundest bodies are mortall and
subject to change, therefore fall into diseases, and from diseases
to death. Now the two chiefe messengers of mortality, be <i>Feavers</i>
and <i>Callentures</i>; but they be easily helpt, if taken in
time, and as easily prevented of any that will not prove a
meere foole to his body. For the common diseases of <i>England</i>,
they be strangers to the <i>English</i> now in that strange Land.
To my knowledge I never knew any that had the Poxe, Measels,
Greene-sicknesse, Head-aches, Stone, or Consumptions,
&amp;c. Many that have come infirme out of <i>England</i>,
retaine their old grievances still, and some that were long
troubled with lingering diseases, as Coughs of the lungs,
Consumptions, &amp;c. have beene restored by that medicineable
Climate to their former strength and health. God hath beene
pleased so to blesse men in the health of their bodies, that I
dare confidently say it, out of that Towne from whence I
came, in three yeares and a halfe, there dyed but three, one
of which was crazed before he came into the Land; the other
were two Children borne at one birth before their time, the
Mother being accidentally hurt. To make good which losses,
I have seene foure Children Baptized at a time, which wipes
away that common aspersion, that women have no Children,
being a meere falsity, there being as sweete lusty Children
as in any other Nation, and reckoning so many for so
many, more double births than in <i>England</i>; the women likewise
<span class='pageno' title='10' id='Page_10'></span>having a more speedy recovery, and gathering of strength
after their delivery than in <i>England</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>The last Argument to confirme the healthfulnesse of the
Countrey, shall be from mine owne experience, who although
in <i>England</i> I was brought up tenderly under the
carefull hatching of my dearest friends, yet scarce could I be
acquainted with health, having beene let blood sixe times
for the <i>Pleurisie</i> before I went; likewise being assailed with other
weakning diseases; but being planted in that new Soyle
and healthfull Ayre, which was more correspondent to my
nature, (I speake it with praise to the mercifull God) though
my occasions have beene to passe thorow heate and cold, wet,
and dry, by Sea and Land, in Winter and Summer, day by
day, for foure yeares together, yet scarse did I know what
belonged to a dayes sicknesse.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><i>Of the nature of the Soyle.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The Soyle is for the generall a warme kinde of earth, there
being little cold-spewing land, no Morish Fennes, no
Quagmires, the lowest grounds be the Marshes, over which
every full and change the Sea flowes: these Marshes be rich
ground, and bring plenty of Hay, of which the Cattle feed
and like, as if they were fed with the best up-land Hay in
<i>New England</i>; of which likewise there is great store which
growes commonly betweene the Marshes and the Woods.
This Medow ground lies higher than the Marshes, whereby it
is freed from the over-flowing of the Seas; and besides this,
in many places where the Trees grow thinne, there is good
fodder to be got amongst the Woods. There be likewise in
divers places neare the plantations great broad Medowes
wherein grow neither shrub nor Tree, lying low, in which
Plaines growes as much grasse, as may be throwne out with
a Sithe, thicke and long, as high as a mans middle; some as
high as the shoulders, so that a good mower may cut three
loads in a day. But many object, this is but a course fodder:
<span class='pageno' title='11' id='Page_11'></span>True it is, that it is not so fine to the eye as <i>English</i> grasse,
but it is not sowre, though it grow thus ranke; but being
made into Hay, the Cattle eate it as well as it were Lea-hay
and like as well with it; I doe not thinke <i>England</i> can shew
fairer Cattle either in Winter, or Summer, than is in those parts
both Winter and Summer; being generally larger and better of
milch, and bring forth young as ordinarily as Cattle doe in
<i>England</i>, and have hitherto beene free from many diseases
that are incident to Cattle in <i>England</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>To returne to the Subject in hand, there is so much hay-ground
in the Countrey, as the richest voyagers that shall
venture thither, neede not feare want of fodder, though
his Heard increase into thousands, there being thousands of
Acres that yet was never medled with. And whereas it hath
beene reported, that some hath mowne a day for halfe of a
loade of Hay: I doe not say, but it may be true, a man may
doe as much, and get as little in <i>England</i>, on <i>Salisbury</i> Plaine,
or in other places where Grasse cannot be expected: So Hay-ground
is not in all places in <i>New England</i>: Wherefore it shall
behoue every man according to his calling, and estate, to looke
for a fit situation at the first, and if hee be one that intends to
live on his stocke, to choose the grassie Vallies before the
woody Mountaines. Furthermore, whereas it hath beene generally
reported in many places of <i>England</i>, that the Grasse
growes not in those places where it was cut the fore-going
yeares, it is a meere falshood; for it growes as well the ensuing
Spring as it did before, and is more spiery and thicke,
like our <i>English</i> Grasse: and in such places where the Cattle
use to graze, the ground is much improved in the Woods,
growing more grassie, and lesse weedy. The worst that can be
sayd against the meddow grounds, is because there is little
edish, or after-pasture, which may proceede from the late
mowing, more than from any thing else; but though the edish
be not worth much, yet is there such plenty of other Grasse
and seeding, that there is no want of Winter-fodder till <i>December</i>,
at which time men beginne to house their milch-cattle
and Calves: Some, notwithstanding the cold of the
Winter, have their Young Cattle without doores, giving
<span class='pageno' title='12' id='Page_12'></span>them meate at morning and evening. For the more upland
grounds, there be different kinds, in some places clay, some
gravell, some a red sand; all which are covered with a black
mould, in some places above a foote deepe, in other places
not so deepe. There be very few that have the experience of
the ground, that can condemne it of barrennesse; although
many deeme it barren, because the <i>English</i> use to manure
their land with fish, which they doe not because the land
could not bring corne without it, but because it brings more
with it; the land likewise being kept in hart the longer: besides,
the plenty of fish which they have for little or nothing,
is better so used, than cast away; but to argue the goodnesse
of the ground, the <i>Indians</i> who are too lazie to catch fish,
plant corne eight or ten yeares in one place without it, having
very good crops. Such is the rankenesse of the ground
that it must bee sowne the first yeare with <i>Indian</i> Corne,
which is a soaking graine, before it will be fit for to receive
<i>English</i> seede. In a word, as there is no ground so purely
good, as the long forced and improoved grounds of <i>England</i>,
so is there none so extreamely bad as in many places of
<i>England</i>, that as yet have not beene manured and improved;
the woods of <i>New England</i> being accounted better
ground than the Forrests of <i>England</i> or woodland ground,
or heathy plaines.</p>

<p class='c005'>For the naturall soyle, I preferre it before the countrey of
Surry, or Middlesex, which if they were not inriched with
continuall manurings, would be lesse fertile than the meanest
ground in <i>New England</i>; wherefore it is neyther impossible,
nor much improbable, that upon improvements the soile
may be as good in time as <i>England</i>. And whereas some gather
the ground to be naught, and soone out of hart, because
<i>Plimouth</i> men remove from their old habitations, I answer,
they do no more remove from their habitation, than the Citizen
which hath one house in the Citty &amp; another in the Countrey,
for his pleasure, health, &amp; profit. For although they have
taken new plots of ground, and built houses upon them, yet
doe they retaine their old houses still, and repaire to them,
every Sabbath day; neyther doe they esteeme their old lots
<span class='pageno' title='13' id='Page_13'></span>worse than when they first tooke them: what if they doe
not plant on them every yeare? I hope it is no ill husbandry
to rest the land, nor is alwayes that the worst that lies sometimes
fallow. If any man doubt of the goodnesse of the
ground, let him comfort himselfe with the cheapenesse of it;
such bad land in <i>England</i> I am sure wil bring in store of good
monie. This ground is in some places of a soft mould, and
easie to plow; in other places so tough and hard, that I have
seene ten Oxen toyled, their Iron chaines broken, and their
Shares and Coulters much strained: but after the first breaking
up it is so easie, that two Oxen and a Horse may plow
it; there hath as good <i>English</i> Corne growne there, as could
be desired; especially Rie and Oates, and Barly: there hath
beene no great tryall as yet of Wheate, and Beanes; onely
thus much I affirme, that these two graines grow well in
Gardens, therefore it is not improbable, but when they can
gather seede of that which is sowne in the countrey, it may
grow as well as any other Graine: but commonly the seede
that commeth out of <i>England</i> is heated at Sea, and therefore
cannot thrive at land.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><i>Of the Hearbes, Fruites, Woods, Waters and Mineralls.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The ground affoards very good kitchin Gardens, for
Turneps, Parsnips, Carrots, Radishes, and Pumpions,
Muskmillions, Isquoutersquashes, Coucumbers, Onyons, and
whatsoever growes well in <i>England</i>, growes as well there,
many things being better and larger: there is likewise growing
all manner of Hearbes for meate, and medicine, and
that not onely in planted Gardens, but in the Woods, without
eyther the art or the helpe of man, as sweet Marjoram,
Purselane, Sorrell, Peneriall, Yarrow, Mirtle, Saxifarilla,
Bayes, &amp;c. There is likewise Strawberries in abundance, very
large ones, some being two inches about; one may gather
halfe a bushell in a forenoone: In other seasons there bee
<span class='pageno' title='14' id='Page_14'></span>Gooseberries, Bilberies, Resberies, Treackleberies, Hurtleberries,
Currants; which being dryed in the Sunne are little
inferiour to those that our Grocers sell in <i>England</i>: This
land likewise affoards Hempe and Flax, some naturally, and
some planted by the <i>English</i>, with Rapes if they bee well
managed. For such commodities as lie underground, I cannot
out of mine owne experience or knowledge say much,
having taken no great notice of such things; but it is certainely
reported that there is Iron stone; and the <i>Indians</i> informe
us that they can leade us to the mountaines of blacke
Lead, and have showne us lead ore, if our small judgement
in such things doe not deceive us: and though no body dare
confidently conclude, yet dare they not utterly deny, but that
the <i>Spaniards</i> blisse may lye hid in the barren Mountaines;
such as have coasted the countrey affirme that they know
where to fetch Seacole if wood were scant; there is plenty
of stone both rough and smooth, usefull for many things,
with quarries of Slate, out of which they get covering
for houses, with good clay, whereof they make Tiles and
Brickes, and pavements for their necessary uses.</p>

<p class='c005'>For the Countrey it is as well watered as any land under
the Sunne, every family, or every two families having a
spring of sweet waters betwixt them, which is farre different
from the waters of <i>England</i>, being not so sharpe, but of
a fatter substance, and of a more jetty colour; it is thought
there can be no better water in the world, yet dare I not preferre
it before good Beere, as some have done, but any man
will choose it before bad Beere, Wheay, or Buttermilke.
Those that drinke it be as healthfull, fresh, and lustie, as they
that drinke beere; These springs be not onely within land,
but likewise bordering upon the Sea coasts, so that some
times the tides overflow some of them, which is accounted
rare in the most parts of <i>England</i>. No man hitherto hath
beene constrained to digge deepe for his water, or to fetch
it farre, or to fetch of severall waters for severall uses; one
kind of water serving for washing, and brewing and other
things. Now besides these springs, there be divers spacious
ponds in many places of the Countrey, out of which
<span class='pageno' title='15' id='Page_15'></span>runne many sweet streames, which are constant in their
course both winter and summer, whereat the Cattle quench
their thirst, and upon which may be built water mills, as
the plantation encreases.</p>

<p class='c005'>The next commoditie the land affords, is good store of
Woods, &amp; that not onely such as may be needfull for fewell,
but likewise for the building of Ships, and houses, &amp; Mils, and
all manner of water-worke about which Wood is needefull.
The Timber of the Countrey growes straight, and tall, some
trees being twenty, some thirty foot high, before they spread
forth their branches; generally the Trees be not very thicke,
though there be many that will serve for Mill posts, some
beeing three foote and a halfe o're. And whereas it is generally
conceived, that the woods grow so thicke, that there
is no more cleare ground than is hewed out by labour of
man; it is nothing so; in many places, divers Acres being
cleare, so that one may ride a hunting in most places of the
land, if he will venture himselfe for being lost: there is
no underwood saving in swamps, and low grounds that are
wet, in which the <i>English</i> get Osiers, and Hasles, and such
small wood as is for their use. Of these swamps, some be
ten, some twenty, some thirty miles long, being preserved
by the wetnesse of the soile wherein they grow; for it being
the custome of the <i>Indians</i> to burne the wood in <i>November</i>,
when the grasse is withered, and leaves dryed, it consumes
all the underwood, and rubbish, which otherwise
would over grow the Country, making it unpassable, and
spoile their much affected hunting: so that by this meanes
in those places where the <i>Indians</i> inhabit, there is scarce a
bush or bramble, or any combersome underwood to bee
seene in the more champion ground. Small wood growing
in these places where the fire could not come, is preserved.
In some places where the <i>Indians</i> dyed of the Plague some
foureteene yeares agoe, is much underwood, as in the mid
way betwixt <i>Wessaguscus</i> and <i>Plimouth</i>, because it hath not
beene burned; certaine Rivers stopping the fire from comming
to cleare that place of the countrey, hath made it unusefull
and troublesome to travell thorow, in so much that
<span class='pageno' title='16' id='Page_16'></span>it is called ragged plaine, because it teares and rents the
cloathes of them that passe. Now because it may be necessary
for mechanicall artificers to know what Timber, and
wood of use is in the Countrey, I will recite the most usefull
as followeth.</p>

<div class='lg-container-l'>
 <div class='linegroup c013'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Trees both in hills and plaines, in plenty be,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>The long liv'd Oake, and mournfull Cypris tree,</i></div>

      <div class='line'><i>The boatmen seeke for Oares light, neate growne sprewse,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>The brittle Ash, the ever trembling Aspes,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>The broad-spread Elme, whose concave harbours waspes,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>The water spungie Alder good for nought,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>Small Elderne by th' </i>Indian<i> Fletchers sought,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>The knottie Maple, pallid Birtch, Hawthornes,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>The Horne bound tree that to be cloven scornes;</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>Which from the tender Vine oft takes his spouse,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>Who twinds imbracing armes about his boughes.</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>Within this </i>Indian<i> Orchard fruites be some,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>The ruddie Cherrie, and the jettie Plumbe,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>Snake murthering Hazell, with sweet Saxaphrage,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>Whose spurnes in beere allayes hot fevers rage.</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>The Diars Shumach, with more trees there be,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>That are both good to use, and rare to see.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Though many of these trees may seeme to have epithites
contrary to the nature of them as they grow in <i>England</i>,
yet are they agreeable with the Trees of that Countrie. The
chiefe and common Timber for ordinary use is Oake, and
Walnut: Of Oakes there be three kindes, the red Oake,
white, and blacke; as these are different in kinde, so are they
chosen for such uses as they are most fit for, one kind being
more fit for clappboard, others for sawne board, some fitter
for shipping, others for houses. These Trees affoard much
Mast for Hogges, especially every third yeare, bearing a
bigger Acorne than our <i>English</i> Oake. The Wallnut tree is
<span class='pageno' title='17' id='Page_17'></span>something different from the <i>English</i> Wallnut, being a
great deale more tough, and more serviceable, and altogether
as heavie: and whereas our Gunnes that are stocked
with <i>English</i> Wallnut, are soone broaken and cracked in
frost, beeing a brittle Wood; we are driven to stocke them
new with the Country Wallnut, which will indure all
blowes, and weather; lasting time out of minde. These trees
beare a very good Nut, something smaller, but nothing
inferiour in sweetnesse and goodnesse to the <i>English</i>
Nut, having no bitter pill. There is likewise a tree in some
part of the Countrey, that beares a Nut as bigge as a small
peare. The Cedar tree is a tree of no great growth, not
bearing above a foot and a halfe square at the most, neither
is it very high. I suppose they be much inferiour to the
Cedars of <i>Lebanon</i> so much commended in holy writ. This
wood is more desired for ornament than substance, being
of colour red and white like Eugh, smelling as sweete as
Iuniper; it is commonly used for seeling of houses, and making
of Chests, Boxes, and staves. The Firre and Pine bee
trees that grow in many places, shooting up exceeding high,
especially the Pine: they doe afford good masts, good board,
Rozin and Turpentine. Out of these Pines is gotten the
candlewood that is so much spoken of, which may serve
for a shift amongst poore folkes; but I cannot commend it
for singular good, because it is something sluttish, dropping
a pitchie kinde of substance where it stands. Here no
doubt might be good done with saw mils; for I have seene
of these stately highgrowne trees, ten miles together close
by the River side, from whence by shipping they might be
conveyed to any desired Port. Likewise it is not improbable
that Pitch and Tarre may be forced from these trees, which
beare no other kinde of fruite. For that countrey Ash, it
is much different from the Ash of <i>England</i>, being brittle and
good for little, so that Wallnut is used for it. The Horne-bound
tree is a tough kind of Wood, that requires so much
paines in riving as is almost incredible, being the best for
to make bolles and dishes, not being subject to cracke or
leake. This tree growing with broad spread Armes, the
<span class='pageno' title='18' id='Page_18'></span>vines winde their curling branches about them; which
vines affoard great store of grapes, which are very big both
for the grape and Cluster, sweet and good: These be of two
sorts, red and white, there is likewise a smaller kind of grape,
which groweth in the Islands which is sooner ripe and more
delectable; so that there is no knowne reason why as good
wine may not be made in those parts, as well as in <i>Burdeuax</i>
in <i>France</i>; being under the same degree. It is great pittie
no man sets upon such a venture, whereby he might in small
time inrich himselfe, and benefit the Countrie; I know nothing
which doth hinder but want of skilfull men to manage
such an imployment: For the countrey is hot enough, the
ground good enough, and many convenient hills which
lye toward the south Sunne, as if they were there placed for
the purpose. The Cherrie trees yeeld great store of Cherries,
which grow on clusters like grapes; they be much smaller
than our <i>English</i> Cherrie, nothing neare so good if they be
not very ripe: they so furre the mouth that the tongue will
cleave to the roofe, and the throate wax horse with swallowing
those red Bullies (as I may call them,) being little
better in taste. <i>English</i> ordering may bring them to be an <i>English</i>
Cherrie, but yet they are as wilde as the <i>Indians</i>. The
Plummes of the Countrey be better for Plummes than the
Cherries be for Cherries, they be blacke and yellow about
the bignesse of a Damson, of a reasonable good taste. The
white thorne affords hawes as bigge as an <i>English</i> Cherrie,
which is esteemed above a Cherrie for his goodnesse and
pleasantnesse to the taste.</p>

<p class='c005'>Concerning Lyons, I will not say that I ever saw any my
selfe, but some affirme that they have seene a Lyon at <i>Cape
Anne</i> which is not above six leagues from <i>Boston</i>: some likewise
being lost in woods, have heard such terrible roarings,
as have made them much agast; which must eyther be Devills
or Lyons; there being no other creatures which use
to roare saving Beares, which have not such a terrible kind
of roaring: besides, <i>Plimouth</i> men have traded for Lyons
skinnes in former times. But sure it is that there be Lyons
on that Continent, for the <i>Virginians</i> saw an old Lyon in
their plantations, who having lost his Iackall, which was
wont to hunt his prey, was brought so poore that he could
goe no further. For Beares they be common, being a great
blacke kind of Beare, which be most feirce in Strawberry
time, at which time they have young ones; at this time likewise
they will goe upright like a man, and clime trees, and
swimme to the Islands; which if the <i>Indians</i> see, there will
be more sportfull Beare bayting than Paris Garden can affoard.
For seeing the Beares take water, an <i>Indian</i> will
leape after him, where they goe to water cuffes for bloody
<span class='pageno' title='20' id='Page_20'></span>noses, and scratched sides; in the end the man gets the victory,
riding the Beare over the watery plaine till he can beare
him no longer. In the winter they take themselves to the
clifts of rockes, and thicke swamps, to shelter them from
the cold; and foode being scant in those cold and hard times,
they live onely by sleeping and sucking their pawes, which
keepeth them as fat as they are in Summer; there would be
more of them if it were not for the Woolves, which devoure
them; a kennell of those ravening runnagadoes, setting
on a poore single Beare, will teare him as a Dogge will
teare a Kid: it would be a good change if the countrey had
for every Woolfe a Beare, upon the condition all the
woolves were banished; so should the inhabitants be not onely
rid of their greatest annoyance, but furnished with more
store of provisions, Beares being accounted very good
meate, esteemed of all men above Venison: againe they never
prey upon the <i>English</i> cattle, or offer to assault the person
of any man, unlesse being vexed with a shot, and a man
run upon them before they be dead, in which case they will
stand in their owne defence, as may appeare by this instance.
Two men going a fowling, appointed at evening to meete
at a certaine pond side, to share equally, and to returne home;
one of these Gunners having killed a Seale or Sea calfe,
brought it to the side of the pond where hee was to meete
his comrade, afterwards returning to the Sea side for more
gaine; and having loaded himselfe with more Geese and
Duckes, he repaired to the pond, where hee saw a great
Beare feeding on his Seale, which caused him to throw
downe his loade, and give the Beare a salute; which though
it was but with Goose shot, yet tumbled him over
and over, whereupon the man supposing him to be in a manner
dead, ran and beate him with the hand of his Gunne;
The Beare perceiving him to be such a coward to strike him
when he was down, scrambled up, standing at defiance with
him, scratching his legges, tearing his cloathes and face,
who stood it out till his six foot Gunne was broken in the
middle, then being deprived of his weapon, he ran up to
the shoulders into the pond, where hee remained till the
<span class='pageno' title='21' id='Page_21'></span>Beare was gone, and his mate come in, who accompanied
him home.</p>

<p class='c005'>The beast called a Moose, is not much unlike red Deare,
this beast is as bigge as an Oxe; slow of foote, headed like
a Bucke, with a broade beame, some being two yards wide
in the head, their flesh is as good as Beefe, their hides good
for cloathing; The <i>English</i> have some thoughts of keeping
them tame, and to accustome them to the yoake, which
will be a great commoditie: First because they are so fruitfull,
bringing forth three at a time, being likewise very uberous.
Secondly, because they will live in winter without
any fodder. There be not many of these in the <i>Massachusets
bay</i>, but forty miles to the Northeast there be great store of
them; These pore beasts likewise are much devoured by the
Woolves: The ordinary Deare be much bigger than the
Deare of <i>England</i>, of a brighter colour, more inclining to
red, with spotted bellies; the most store of these be in winter,
when the more Northerne parts of the countrey bee
cold for them; they desire to be neare the Sea, so that they
may swimme to the Islands when they are chased by the
Woolves: It is not to be thought into what great multitudes
they would encrease, were it not for the common devourer
the Woolfe; They have generally three at a time, which
they hide a mile one from another, giving them sucke by
turnes; thus they doe, that if the Woolfe should finde one, he
might misse of the other. These Deare be fat in the deepe
of winter; In Summer it is hard catching of them with the
best Greyhounds that may be procured, because they bee
swift of foote. Some credible persons have affirmed, that
they have seene a Deare leape three score feet at little or no
forcement; besides, there be so many old trees, rotten stumps,
and <i>Indian</i> barnes, that a dog cannot well run without being
shoulder-shot: yet would I not disswade any from carrying
good dogges; for in the winter time they be very usefull;
for when the snow is hard frozen, the Deare being heavie,
sinkes into the snow, the doggs being light runne upon the
top and overtake them, and pull them downe: some by this
meanes have gotten twenty Buckes and Does in a winter,
<span class='pageno' title='22' id='Page_22'></span>the hornes of these Deare grow in such a straight manner,
(overhanging their heads) that they cannot feede upon such
things as grow low, till they have cast their old hornes: of
these Deare there be a great many, and more in the <i>Massachusets bay</i>,
than in any other place, which is a great helpe
and refreshment to these planters. The Porcupine is a
small thing not much unlike a Hedgehog; something bigger,
who stands upon his guard and proclaimes a <i>Noli me
tangere</i>, to man and beast, that shall approach too neare him,
darting his quills into their legges, and hides. The Rackoone
is a deepe furred beast, not much unlike a Badger, having
a tayle like a Fox, as good meate as a Lambe; there is one
of them in the Tower. These beasts in the day time sleepe
in hollow trees, in the moone shine night they goe to feede
on clammes at a low tide, by the Sea side, where the <i>English</i>
hunt them with their dogges. The Squerrells be of three
sorts, first the great gray Squerrell, which is almost as bigge
as an <i>English</i> Rabbet; of these there be the greatest plenty, one
may kill a dozen of them in an afternoone, about three of the
clocke they begin to walke. The second is a small Squerrell,
not unlike the <i>English</i> Squerrell, which doth much trouble
the planters of Corne, so that they are constrained to set divers
Trappes, and to carry their Cats into the Corne fields,
till their corne be three weekes old. The third kind is a flying
Squerrell, which is not very bigge, slender of body,
with a great deale of loose skinne which shee spreads square
when shee flyes, which the winde gets, and so wafts her
Batlike body from place to place; it is a creature more for
sight and wonderment, than eyther pleasure or profit. The
Rabbets be much like ours in <i>England</i>. The Hares be some
of them white, and a yard long; these two harmelesse creatures
are glad to shelter themselves from the harmefull
Foxes, in hollow trees, having a hole at the entrance no
bigger than they can creepe in at: if they should make them
holes in the ground, as our <i>English</i> Rabbets doe, the undermining
Renoilds would rob them of their lives, and extirpate
their generation. The beasts of offence be Squunckes,
Ferrets, Foxes, whose impudence sometimes drives them to the
<span class='pageno' title='23' id='Page_23'></span>good wives Hen roost, to fill their Paunch: some of these
be blacke; their furre is of much esteeme.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Ounce or the wilde Cat, is as big as a mungrell dog,
this creature is by nature feirce, and more dangerous to bee
met withall than any other creature, not fearing eyther
dogge or man; he useth to kill Deare, which hee thus effecteth:
Knowing the Deares tracts, hee will lye lurking in
long weedes, the Deare passing by he suddenly leapes upon
his backe, from thence gets to his necke, and scratcheth out
his throate; he hath likewise a devise to get Geese, for being
much of the colour of a Goose he will place himselfe
close by the water, holding up his bob taile, which is like
a Goose necke; the Geese seeing this counterfet Goose, approach
nigh to visit him, who with a suddaine jerke apprehends
his mistrustlesse prey. The <i>English</i> kill many of these,
accounting them very good meat. Their skinnes be a very
deepe kind of Furre, spotted white and black on the belly.
The Woolves bee in some respect different from them of
other countries; it was never knowne yet that a Woolfe ever
set upon a man or woman. Neyther do they trouble horses
or cowes; but swine, goates and red calves which they
take for Deare, be often destroyed by them, so that a red
calfe is cheaper than a blacke one in that regard; in Autumne
and the beginning of the Spring, these ravenous rangers
doe most frequent our <i>English</i> habitations, following
the Deare which come downe at that time to those parts.
They be made much like a Mungrell, being big boned, lanke
paunched, deepe breasted, having a thicke necke, and head,
pricke eares, and long snoute, with dangerous teeth, long
flaring haire, and a great bush taile; it is thought of many,
that our <i>English</i> Mastiffes might be too hard for them; but
it is no such matter, for they care no more for an ordinary
Mastiffe, than an ordinary Mastiffe cares for a Curre; many
good Dogges have beene spoyled with them. Once a faire
Grayhound hearing them at their howlings run out to chide
them, who was torne in peeces before he could be rescued.
One of them makes no more bones to runne away with a
Pigge, than a Dogge to runne away with a Marrow bone.
<span class='pageno' title='24' id='Page_24'></span>It is observed that they have no joynts from the head to the
tayle, which prevents them from leaping, or suddaine turning,
as may appeare by what I shall shew you. A certaine
man having shot a Woolfe, as he was feeding upon a Swine,
breaking his legge onely, hee knew not how to devise his
death, on a suddaine, the Woolfe being a blacke one, he was
loath to spoyle his furre with a second shot, his skinne being
worth five or sixe pound Sterling; wherefore hee resolved to
get him by the tayle, and thrust him into a River that was
hard by; which effected, the Woolfe being not able to turne
his joyntlesse body to bite him, was taken. That they cannot
leape, may appeare by this Woolfe, whose mouth watering
at a few poore impaled Kiddes, would needes leape over
a five-foote pale to be at them; but his foote slipping in
the rise, he fell a little short of his desire, and being hung
in the Carpenters stockes, howled so loud, that he frighted away
the Kids, and called the <i>English</i>, who killed him. These
be killed dayly in some place or other, either by the <i>English</i>,
or <i>Indian</i>; who have a certaine rate for every head: Yet is
there little hope of their utter destruction, the Countrey being
so spacious, and they so numerous, travelling in the
Swamps by Kennels: sometimes ten or twelve are of a company.
Late at night, and early in the morning, they set up
their howlings, and call their companies together at night
to hunt, at morning to sleepe; in a word they be the greatest
inconveniency the Countrey hath, both for matter of dammage
to private men in particular, and the whole Countrey
in generall.</p>

    <div><i>Beasts living in the water.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>For all creatures that liv'd both by Land and Water, they
be first Otters, which be most of them blacke, whose
furre is much used for Muffes, and are held almost as deare
as Beaver. The flesh of them is none of the best meate, but
<span class='pageno' title='25' id='Page_25'></span>their Oyle is of rare use for many things. Secondly, Martins,
a good furre for their bignesse: Thirdly, Musquashes, which
be much like a Beaver for shape, but nothing neare so bigge;
the Male hath two stones which smell as sweete as Muske,
and being killed in Winter, never lose their sweete smell:
These skinnes are no bigger than a Coney-skinne, yet are
sold for five shillings a peece, being sent for Tokens into <i>England</i>.
One good skinne will perfume a whole house-full of
cloathes, if it be right and good. Fourthly, the Beaver, concerning
whom if I should at large discourse, according to
knowledge or information, I might make a Volumne. The
wisedome and understanding of this Beast, will almost conclude
him a reasonable creature: His shape is thicke and short,
having likewise short legs, feete like a Mole before, and behinde
like a Goose, a broad tayle in forme like a shooe-soale,
very tough and strong; his head is something like an Otters
head, saving that his teeth before, be placed like the teeth
of a Rabbet, two above, and two beneath; sharpe and
broad, with which he cuts downe Trees as thicke as a mans
thigh, afterwards diuiding them into lengths, according to
the use they are appointed for. If one Bever be too weake
to carry the logge, then another helpes him; if they two be
too weake, then <i>Multorum manibus grande levatur onus</i>;
foure more adding their helpe, being placed three to three,
which set their teeth in one anothers tough tayles, and laying
the loade on the two hindermost, they draw the logge to
the desired place. That this may not seeme altogether incredible,
remember that the like almost may be seene in our
Ants, which will joyne sometimes seaven or eight together
in the carrying of a burthen. These Creatures build themselves
houses of wood and clay, close by the Ponds sides, and knowing
the Seasons, build them answerable houses, having
them three stories high, so that as land-floods are raised by
great Raines, as the waters arise, they mount higher in their
houses; as they asswage, they descend lower againe. These
houses are so strong, that no creature saving an industrious
man with his penetrating tooles can prejudice them, their ingresse
and egresse being Vnder water. These make likewise
<span class='pageno' title='26' id='Page_26'></span>very good Ponds, knowing whence a streame runnes from
betweene two rising Hils, they will there pitch downe piles
of Wood, placing smaller rubbish before it with clay and
sods, not leaving, till by their Art and Industry they have
made a firme and curious damme-head, which may draw
admiration from wise understanding men. These creatures
keepe themselves to their owne families, never parting so
long as they are able to keepe house together: And it is commonly
sayd, if any Beaver accidentally light into a strange
place, he is made a drudge so long as he lives there, to carry
at the greater end of the logge, unlesse he creepe away by
stealth. Their wisedome secures them from the <i>English</i>, who
seldome or neuer kills any of them, being not patient to lay
a long siege, or to be so often deceived by their cunning evasions,
so that all the Beaver which the <i>English</i> have, comes
first from the <i>Indians</i>, whose time and experience fits them
for that imployment.</p>

</div>

<p class='c005'>The Eagles of the Countrey be of two sorts, one like the
Eagles that be in <i>England</i>, the other is something bigger
with a great white head, and white tayle: these bee commonly
called Gripes; these prey upon Duckes and Geese,
and such Fish as are cast upon the Sea-shore. And although
an Eagle be counted King of that feathered regiment, yet is
there a certaine blacke Hawke that beates him; so that hee is
constrayned to soare so high, till heate expell his adversary.
This Hawke is much prized of the <i>Indians</i>, being accounted
a Sagamores ransome.</p>

<p class='c005'>To speake much of Hawkes, were to trespasse upon
my owne judgement, and bring upon my selfe a deserved
censure, for abusing the Faulconers termes: But by relation
from those that have more insight into them than my
selfe: There be divers kinds of Hawkes: their Aieries are easie to
<span class='pageno' title='28' id='Page_28'></span>come by, being in the holes of Rockes, neare the shore, so
that any who are addicted to that sport, if he will be but at
the charge of finding Poultry for them, may have his desires.
We could wish them well mew'd in <i>England</i>; for they make
hauocke of Hens, Partridges, Heathcockes, and Duckes; often
hindering the Fowler of his long look't for shoote. The
Humbird is one of the wonders of the Countrey, being no
bigger than a Hornet, yet hath all the demensions of a Bird,
as bill, and wings, with quills, spider-like legges, small
clawes: For colour, she is as glorious as the Raine-bow; as
she flies, she makes a little humming noise like a Humble-bee:
wherefore shee is called the Humbird. The Pigeon of that
Countrey, is something different from our Dove-house Pigeons
in <i>England</i>, being more like Turtles, of the same colour;
but they haue long tayles like a Magpie: And they seeme not
so bigge, because they carry not so many feathers on their
backes as our <i>English</i> Doves, yet are they as bigge in body.
These Birds come into the Countrey, to goe to the North
parts in the beginning of our Spring, at which time (if I
may be counted worthy, to be beleeved in a thing that is not
so strange as true) I have seene them fly as if the Ayerie regiment
had beene Pigeons; seeing neyther beginning nor ending,
length, or breadth of these Millions of Millions. The
shouting of people, the ratling of Gunnes, and pelting of
small shotte could not drive them out of their course, but so
they continued for foure or five houres together: yet it must
not be concluded, that it is thus often; for it is but at the beginning
of the Spring, and at <i>Michaelmas</i>, when they returne
backe to the Southward; yet are there some all the yeare long,
which are easily attayned by such as looke after them. Many
of them build amongst the Pine-trees, thirty miles to the
North-east of our plantations; joyning nest to nest, and tree
to tree by their nests, so that the Sunne never sees the ground
in that place, from whence the <i>Indians</i> fetch whole loades of
them.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Turky is a very large Bird, of a blacke colour, yet
white in flesh; much bigger than our <i>English</i> Turky. He hath
the use of his long legs so ready, that he can runne as fast as a
<span class='pageno' title='29' id='Page_29'></span>Dogge, and flye as well as a Goose: of these sometimes there
will be forty, threescore, and a hundred of a flocke, sometimes
more and sometimes lesse; their feeding is Acornes,
Hawes, and Berries, some of them get a haunt to frequent our
<i>English</i> corne: In winter when the Snow covers the ground,
they resort to the Sea shore to look for Shrimps, &amp; such smal
Fishes at low tides. Such as love Turkie hunting, must follow
it in winter after a new falne Snow, when hee may follow
them by their tracts; some have killed ten or a dozen in halfe
a day; if they can be found towards an evening and watched
where they peirch, if one come about ten or eleaven of
the clocke he may shoote as often as he will, they will sit,
unlesse they be slenderly wounded. These Turkies remaine
all the yeare long, the price of a good Turkie cocke is foure
shillings; and he is well worth it, for he may be in weight
forty pound; a Hen two shillings. Pheasons bee very rare,
but Heathcockes, and Partridges be common; he that is a
husband, and will be stirring betime, may kill halfe a dozen
in a morning.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Partridges be bigger than they be in <i>England</i>, the
flesh of the Heathcockes is red, and the flesh of a Partridge
white, their price is foure pence a peece. The Ravens, and
the Crowes be much like them of other countries. There
are no Magpies, Iackedawes, Coockooes, Iayes, Sparrows,
&amp;c. The Stares be bigger than those in <i>England</i>, as blacke as
Crowes, being the most troublesome, and injurious bird
of all others, pulling up the cornes by the roots, when it is
young, so that those who plant by reedy and sedgy places,
where they frequent, are much annoyed with them, they
being so audacious that they feare not Guns, or their fellowes
hung upon poles; but the Corne having a weeke or
nine dayes growth is past their spoyling. The Owles be of
two sorts; the one being small speckled, like a Partridge,
with eares, the other being a great Owle, almost as big as an
Eagle, his body beeing as good meate as a Partridge. Cormorants
bee as common as other fowles, which destroy
abundance of small fish, these are not worth the shooting
because they are the worst of fowles for meate, tasting
<span class='pageno' title='30' id='Page_30'></span>ranke, and fishy: againe, one may shoot twenty times and
misse, for seeing the fire in the panne, they dive under the
water before the shot comes to the place where they were;
they use to roost upon the tops of trees, and rockes, being a
very heavy drowsie creature, so that the <i>Indians</i> will goe in
their Cannowes in the night, and take them from the
Rockes, as easily as women take a Hen from roost; No
ducking ponds can affoard more delight than a lame Cormorant,
and two or three lusty Dogges. The Crane although
hee bee almost as tall as a man by reason of his long
legges, and necke; yet is his body rounder than other
fowles, not much unlike the body of a Turkie. I have seene
many of these fowles, yet did I never see one that was fat,
I suppose it is contrary to their nature to grow fat; Of these
there be many in Summer, but none in winter, their price
is two shilling. There be likewise many Swannes which
frequent the fresh ponds and rivers, seldome consorting
themselves with Duckes and Geese; these bee very good
meate, the price of one is six shillings. The Geese of the
countrey be of three sorts, first a brant Goose, which is a
Goose almost like the wilde Goose in <i>England</i>, the price
of one of these is six pence. The second kind is a white
Goose, almost as big as an <i>English</i> tame Goose, these come
in great flockes about Michelmasse, sometimes there will
be two or three thousand in a flocke, these continue six
weekes, and so flye to the southward, returning in March, and
staying six weekes more, returning againe to the Northward;
the price of one of these is eight pence. The third
kind of Geese, is a great gray Goose, with a blacke necke, and
a blacke and white head, strong of flight; these bee a great
deale bigger than the ordinary Geese of <i>England</i>, some very
fat, and in the Spring so full of Feathers, that the shot can
scarce peirce them; most of these Geese remaine with us
from Michelmas to Aprill; they feede on the Sea of Fish,
and in the woods of Acornes, having as other Foule have,
their passe and repasse to the Northward and Southward:
the accurate marksmen kill of these both flying and sitting;
the price of a good gray Goose is eighteene pence. The
<span class='pageno' title='31' id='Page_31'></span>Duckes of the countrey be very large ones and in great abundance,
so is there of Teale likewise; the price of a
Ducke is six pence, of a Teale three pence. If I should tell
you how some have killed a hundred Geese in a weeke, 50.
Duckes at a shot, 40. Teales at another, it may be counted
impossible, though nothing more certaine. The Oldwives,
be a foule that never leave tatling day or night, something
bigger than a Ducke. The Loone is an ill shap'd thing like a
Cormorant; but that he can neyther goe nor flye; he maketh
a noise sometimes like a Sowgelders horne. The Humilities
or Simplicities (as I may rather call them) bee of two sorts,
the biggest being as big as a greene Plover, the other as big
as birds we call knots in <i>England</i>. Such is the simplicity of
the smaller sorts of these birds, that one may drive them on
a heape like so many sheepe, and seeing a fit time shoot
them; the living seeing the dead, settle themselves on the
same place againe, amongst which the Fowler discharges againe.
I my selfe have killed twelve score at two shootes:
these bird are to be had upon sandy brakes at the latter end
of Summer before the Geese come in. Thus much have I
shewed you as I know to bee true concerning the Fowle of
the countrey. But me thinkes I heare some say that this is
very good if it could be caught, or likely to continue, and
that much shooting will fright away the fowles. True it
is, that every ones imployment wil not permit him to fowle:
what then? yet their imployments furnish them with silver
Guns with which they may have it more easie. For the
frighting of the fowle, true it is that many goe blurting
away their pouder and shot, that have no more skill to kill,
or winne a Goose, than many in <i>England</i> that have rustie
Muskets in their houses, knowes what belongs to a Souldier,
yet are they not much affrighted. I have seene more living
and dead the last yeare than I have done in former
yeares.</p>

<p class='c014'>Having done with these, let me leade you from the
land to the Sea, to view what commodities may come
from thence; there is no countrey knowne, that yeelds more
variety of fish winter and summer: and that not onely for
the present spending and sustentation of the plantations, but
likewise for trade into other countries, so that those which
have had stages &amp; make fishing voyages into those parts, have
gained (it is thought) more than the new found land Iobbers.
Codfish in these seas are larger than in new found land, six
or seaven making a quintall, whereas there they have fifteene
to the same weight; and though this they seeme a
base and more contemptible commoditie in the judgement
of more neate adventurers, yet it hath bin the enrichment of
other nations, and is likely to prove no small commoditie
to the planters, and likewise to <i>England</i> if it were thorowly
undertaken. Salt may be had from the salt Islands,
and as is supposed may be made in the countrey. The chiefe
fish for trade is Cod, but for the use of the countrey, there
is all manner of fish as followeth.</p>

<p class='c005'>To omit such of these as are not usefull, therefore not to
be spoken of, and onely to certifie you of such as be usefull.
First the Seale which is that which is called the Sea Calfe,
his skinne is good for divers uses, his body being betweene
fish and flesh, it is not very delectable to the pallate, or congruent
with the stomack; his Oyle is very good to burne in
Lampes, of which he affoards a great deale. The Sharke is
a kinde of fish as bigge as a man, some as bigge as a horse,
with three rowes of teeth within his mouth, with which he
snaps asunder the fishermans lines, if he be not very circumspect:
This fish will leape at a mans hand if it be over
board, and with his teeth snap off a mans legge or hand if
he be a swimming; These are often taken, being good for
nothing but to put on the ground for manuring of land. The
Sturgions be all over the countrey, but the best catching of
them be upon the shoales of <i>Cape Codde</i>, and in the River of
<i>Mirrimacke</i>, where much is taken, pickled and brought for
<i>England</i>, some of these be 12.14.18. foote long: I set not
downe the price of fish there, because it is so cheape, so that
one may have as much for two pence, as would give him an
angell in <i>England</i>. The Sammon is as good as it is in <i>England</i>
and in great plenty. The Hollibut is not much unlike
a pleace or Turbut, some being two yards long, and one wide,
and a foot thicke; the plenty of better fish makes these of
little esteeme, except the head and finnes, which stewed or
<span class='pageno' title='34' id='Page_34'></span>baked is very good: these Hollibuts be little set by while
Basse is in season. Thornebacke and Scates is given to the
dogges, being not counted worth the dressing in many places.
The Basse is one of the best fishes in the countrey, and
though men are soone wearied with other fish, yet are they
never with Basse; it is a delicate, fine, fat, fast fish, having a
bone in his head, which containes a sawcerfull of marrow
sweet and good, pleasant to the pallat, and wholsome to
the stomack. When there be great store of them, we onely
eate the heads, and salt up the bodies for winter, which exceedes
Ling or Haberdine. Of these fishes some be three and
some foure foot long, some bigger, some lesser: at some
tides a man may catch a dozen or twenty of these in three
houres, the way to catch them is with hooke and line:
The Fisherman taking a great Cod-line, to which he fastneth
a peece of Lobster, and throwes it into the Sea, the fish biting
at it he pulls her to him, and knockes her on the head
with a sticke. These are at one time (when Alewives
passe up the Rivers) to be catched in Rivers, in Lobster time
at the Rockes, in Macrill time in the Bayes, at Michelmas
in the Seas. When they use to tide it in and out to the Rivers
and Creekes, the <i>English</i> at the top of an high water
do crosse the Creekes with long seanes or Basse Netts,
which stop in the fish; and the water ebbing from them they
are left on the dry ground, sometimes two or three thousand
at a set, which are salted up against winter, or distributed
to such as have present occasion either to spend them in
their houses, or use them for their ground. The Herrings
be much like them that be caught on the <i>English</i> coasts.
Alewives be a kind of fish which is much like a Herring,
which in the latter end of Aprill come up to the fresh Rivers
to spawne, in such multitudes as is allmost incredible,
pressing up in such shallow waters as will scarce permit
them to swimme, having likewise such longing desire after
the fresh water ponds, that no beatings with poles, or forcive
agitations by other devices, will cause them to returne
to the sea, till they have cast their Spawne. The Shaddes be
bigger than the <i>English</i> Shaddes and fatter. The Macrells be
<span class='pageno' title='35' id='Page_35'></span>of two sorts, in the beginning of the yeare are great ones,
which be upon the coast; some are 18. inches long. In Summer
as in May, Iune, Iuly, and August, come in a smaller kind of
them: These Macrills are taken with drailes which is a long
small line, with a lead and hooke at the end of it, being baited
with a peece of red cloath: this kind of fish is counted a
leane fish in <i>England</i>, but there it is so fat, that it can scarce be
saved against winter without reisting. There be a great store
of Salt water Eeles, especially in such places where grasse
growes: for to take these there be certaine Eele pots made of
Osyers, which must be baited with a peece of Lobster, into
which the Eeles entring cannot returne backe againe: some
take a bushell in a night in this manner, eating as many as
they have neede of for the present, and salt up the rest against
winter. These Eeles be not of so luscious a tast as they be in
<i>England</i>, neyther are they so aguish, but are both wholesome
for the body, and delightfull for the taste: Lamprons
and Lampreyes be not much set by; Lobsters be in plenty
in most places, very large ones, some being 20. pound in
weight; these are taken at a low water amongst the rockes,
they are very good fish, the small ones being the best, their
plenty makes them little esteemed and seldome eaten. The
<i>Indians</i> get many of them every day for to baite their hookes
withall, and to eate when they can get no Basse: The Oisters
be great ones in forme of a shoo horne, some be a foote
long, these breede on certaine bankes that are bare every
spring tide. This fish without the shell is so big that it
must admit of a devision before you can well get it into
your mouth. The Perewig is a kind of fish that lyeth in
the oaze like a head of haire, which being touched conveyes
it selfe leaving nothing to bee seene but a small round
hole. Muscles be in great plenty, left onely for the Hogges,
which if they were in <i>England</i> would be more esteemed of
the poorer sort. Clamms or Clamps is a shel-fish not much
unlike a cockle, it lyeth under the sand, every six or seaven
of them having a round hole to take ayre and receive water
at. When the tide ebs and flowes, a man running over these
Clamm bankes will presently be made all wet, by their spouting
<span class='pageno' title='36' id='Page_36'></span>of water out of those small holes: These fishes be in
great plenty in most places of the countrey, which is a great
commoditie for the feeding of Swine, both in winter, and
Summer; for being once used to those places, they will repaire
to them as duely every ebbe, as if they were driven to
them by keepers: In some places of the countrey there
bee Clamms as bigge as a pennie white loafe, which are
great dainties amongst the natives, and would bee in
good esteeme amongst the <i>English</i>, were it not for better
fish.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Wessaguscus.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Dorchester.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Roxberry.</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Having described the situation of the countrey in generall,
with all his commodities arising from land and
Sea, it may adde to your content and satisfaction to be informed
of the situation of every severall plantation, with his
conveniences, commodities, and discommodities, &amp;c. where
first I will begin with the outmost plantation in the patent
to the South ward, which is called <i>Wessaguscus</i> an <i>Indian</i>
name: this as yet is but a small Village, yet it is very pleasant,
and healthfull, very good ground, and is well timbred,
and hath good store of Hey ground; it hath a very spacious
harbour for shipping before the towne; the salt water being
navigable for Boates &amp; Pinnaces two leagues. Here the inhabitants
have good store of fish of all sorts, and Swine, having
Acornes and Clamms at the time of yeare; here is likewise
an Alewife river. Three miles to the North of this is
mount <i>Walleston</i>, a very fertile soyle, and a place very convenient
for Farmers houses, there being great store of plaine
ground, without trees. This place is called <i>Massachusets fields</i>
where the greatest <i>Sagamore</i> in the countrey lived, before the
Plague, who caused it to be cleared for himselfe. The greatest
inconvenience is, that there is not very many Springs, as
in other places of the countrey, yet water may bee had
for digging: A second inconvenience is, that Boates cannot
<span class='pageno' title='37' id='Page_37'></span>come in at a low water, nor ships ride neare the shore.
Sixe miles further to the North, lieth <i>Dorchester</i>; which is
the greatest Towne in <i>New England</i>; well woodded and watered;
very good arable grounds, and Hay-ground, faire
Corne-fields, and pleasant Gardens, with Kitchin-gardens.
In this plantation is a great many Cattle, as Kine, Goats, and
Swine. This plantation hath a reasonable Harbour for ships:
Here is no Alewife-river, which is a great inconvenience. The
inhabitants of this towne, were the first that set upon the
trade of fishing in the Bay, who received so much fruite of
their labours, that they encouraged others to the same undertakings.
A mile from this Towne lieth <i>Roxberry</i>, which is
a faire and handsome Countrey-towne; the inhabitants of it
being all very rich. This Towne lieth upon the Maine, so that
it is well woodded and watered; having a cleare and fresh
Brooke running through the Towne: Vp which although
there come no Alewives, yet there is great store of Smelts,
and therefore it is called Smelt-brooke.</p>

<p class='c005'>A quarter of a mile to the North-side of the Towne, is another
River called <i>Stony-river</i>; upon which is built a water-milne.
Here is good ground for Corne, and Medow for Cattle:
Vp westward from the Towne it is something rocky,
whence it hath the name of <i>Roxberry</i>; the inhabitants have
faire houses, store of Cattle, impaled Corne-fields, and
fruitfull Gardens. Here is no Harbour for ships, because the
Towne is seated in the bottome of a shallow Bay, which is
made by the necke of land on which <i>Boston</i> is built; so that
they can transport all their goods from the Ships in Boats
from <i>Boston</i>, which is the nearest Harbour.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Boston.</i></div>

<p class='c005'><i>Boston</i> is two miles North-east from <i>Roxberry</i>: His situation
is very pleasant, being a <i>Peninsula</i>, hem'd in on the
South-side with the Bay of <i>Roxberry</i>, on the North-side with
<i>Charles-river</i>, the Marshes on the backe-side, being not halfe
a quarter of a mile over; so that a little fencing will secure their
Cattle from the Woolues. Their greatest wants be Wood,
and Medow-ground, which never were in that place; being
constrayned to fetch their building-timber, and fire-wood
from the Ilands in Boates, and their Hay in Loyters: It being
<span class='pageno' title='38' id='Page_38'></span>a necke and bare of wood: they are not troubled with three
great annoyances, of Woolves, Rattle-snakes, and Musketoes.
These that live here upon their Cattle, must be constrayned
to take Farmes in the Countrey, or else they cannot
subsist; the place being too small to containe many, and
fittest for such as can Trade into <i>England</i>, for such commodities
as the Countrey wants, being the chiefe place for
shipping and Merchandize.</p>

<p class='c005'>This <i>Necke of land</i> is not above foure miles in compasse, in
forme almost square, having on the South-side at one corner,
a great broad hill, whereon is planted a Fort, which can command
any ship as shee sayles into any Harbour within the still
Bay. On the North-side is another Hill, equall in bignesse,
whereon stands a Winde-mill. To the North-west is a high
Mountaine with three little rising Hils on the top of it, wherefore
it is called the <i>Tramount</i>. From the top of this Mountaine
a man may over-looke all the Ilands which lie before
the Bay, and discry such ships as are upon the Sea-coast. This
Towne although it be neither the greatest, nor the richest, yet
it is the most noted and frequented, being the Center of the
Plantations where the monthly Courts are kept. Here likewise
dwells the Governour: This place hath very good land, affording
rich Corne-fields, and fruitefull Gardens; having likewise
sweete and pleasant Springs. The inhabitants of this
place for their enlargement, have taken to themselves Farme-houses,
in a place called <i>Muddy-river</i>, two miles from their
Towne; where is good ground, large timber, and store of
Marsh-land, and Medow. In this place they keepe their
Swine and other Cattle in the Summer, whilst the Corne is
on the ground at <i>Boston</i>, and bring them to the Towne in
Winter.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Charles-Towne.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Medford.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>New-towne.</i></div>

<p class='c005'>On the North side of <i>Charles River</i> is <i>Charles Towne</i>,
which is another necke of Land, on whose North-side runs
<i>Misticke-river</i>. This Towne for all things, may be well paralel'd
with her neighbour <i>Boston</i>, being in the same fashion
with her bare necke, and constrained to borrow conveniences
from the Maine, and to provide for themselves Farmes in
the Countrey for their better subsistance. At this Towne
<span class='pageno' title='39' id='Page_39'></span>there is kept a Ferry-boate, to conveigh passengers over
<i>Charles River</i>, which betweene the two Townes is a quarter
of a mile over, being a very deepe Channell. Here may
ride forty ships at a time. Vp higher it is a broad Bay, being
above two miles betweene the shores, into which runnes <i>Stony-river</i>,
and <i>Muddy-river</i>. Towards the South-west in the
middle of this Bay, is a great Oyster-banke: Towards the
North-west of this Bay is a great Creeke, upon whose shore
is situated the Village of <i>Medford</i>, a very fertile and pleasant
place, and fit for more inhabitants than are yet in it. This
Towne is a mile and a halfe from <i>Charles Towne</i>, and at the
bottome of this Bay the River beginnes to be narrower, being
but halfe a quarter of a mile broad. By the side of this River is
built <i>New-towne</i>, which is three miles by land from <i>Charles
Towne</i>, and a league and a halfe by water. This place was
first intended for a City, but upon more serious considerations
it was not thought so fit, being too farre from the Sea; being
the greatest inconvenience it hath. This is one of the neatest
and best compacted Townes in <i>New England</i>, having
many faire structures, with many handsome contrived streets.
The inhabitants most of them are very rich, and well stored
with Cattell of all sorts; having many hundred Acres of ground
paled in with one generall fence, which is about a mile and a
halfe long, which secures all their weaker Cattle from the
wilde beasts. On the other side of the River lieth all their
Medow and Marsh-ground for Hay.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Water-towne.</i></div>

<p class='c005'>Halfe a mile Westward of this plantation, is <i>Water-towne</i>;
a place nothing inferiour for land, wood, medow, and water
to <i>New-towne</i>. Within halfe a mile of this Towne is a great
Pond, which is divided betweene those two Townes, which
divides their bounds Northward. A mile and a halfe from
this Towne, is a fall of fresh waters, which conveigh themselves
into the Ocean through <i>Charles River</i>. A little below
this fall of waters, the inhabitants of <i>Water-towne</i> have built
a Wayre to catch Fish, wherein they take great store of <i>Shads</i>
and <i>Alewives</i>. In two Tydes they have gotten one hundred
thousand of those Fishes: This is no small benefit to the plantation:
Ships of small burden may come up to these two
<span class='pageno' title='40' id='Page_40'></span>Townes, but the Oyster-bankes doe barre out the bigger
Ships.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Misticke.</i></div>

<p class='c005'>The next Towne is <i>Misticke</i>, which is three miles from
<i>Charles Towne</i> by land, and a league and a halfe by water:
It is seated by the waters side very pleasantly; there be not many
houses as yet. At the head of this River are great and spacious
Ponds, whither the <i>Alewives</i> preasse to spawne. This
being a noted place for that kinde of Fish, the <i>English</i> resort
thither to take them. On the West side of this River the Governour
hath a Farme, where he keepes most of his Cattle. On
the East side is Maister <i>Craddockes</i> plantation, where he hath
impaled a Parke, where he keepes his Cattle till he can store
it with Deere: Here likewise he is at charges of building ships.
The last yeare one was upon the Stockes of a hundred Tunne,
that being finished, they are to build one twice her burden.
Ships without either Ballast or loading, may floate downe
this River; otherwise the Oyster-banke would hinder them
which crosseth the Channell.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Winnisimet.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Ilands there</i></div>

<p class='c005'>The last Towne in the still Bay, is <i>Winnisimet</i>; a very sweet
place for situation, and stands very commodiously, being fit
to entertaine more planters than are yet seated: it is within a
mile of <i>Charles Towne</i>, the River onely parting them. The
chiefe Ilands which keepe out the Winde and the Sea from
disturbing the Harbours, are first <i>Deare Iland</i>, which lies
within a flight-shot of <i>Pullin-point</i>. This Iland is so called,
because of the Deare which often swimme thither from the
Maine, when they are chased by the Woolves: Some have killed
sixteene Deere in a day upon this Iland. The opposite
shore is called <i>Pullin-point</i>, because that is the usuall Channel.
Boats use to passe thorow into the Bay; and the Tyde being
very strong, they are constrayned to goe ashore, and hale
their Boats by the seasing, or roades, whereupon it was called
<i>Pullin-point</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>The next Iland of note is <i>Long Iland</i>, so called from his
longitude. Divers other Ilands be within these: <i>viz.</i> <i>Nodles
Ile</i>, <i>Round Ile</i>, the Governours Garden, where is planted
an Orchard and a Vine-yard, with many other conveniences;
and <i>Slate-Iland</i>, <i>Glasse-Iland</i>, <i>Bird-Iland</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> These Iles
<span class='pageno' title='41' id='Page_41'></span>abound with Woods, and Water, and Medow-ground; and
whatsoever the spacious fertile Maine affords. The inhabitants
use to put their Cattle in these for safety, <i>viz.</i> their
Rammes, Goates, and Swine, when their Corne is on the
ground. Those Townes that lie without the Bay, are a great
deale nearer the Maine, and reape a greater benefit from the
Sea, in regard of the plenty both of Fish and Fowle, which
they receive from thence: so that they liue more comfortably,
and at lesse charges, than those that are more remote from the
Sea in the Inland-plantations.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Saugus.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Nahant.</i></div>

<p class='c005'>The next plantation is <i>Saugus</i>, sixe miles North-east from
<i>Winnesimet</i>: This Towne is pleasant for situation, seated at
the bottome of a Bay, which is made on the one side with
the surrounding shore, and on the other side with a long sandy
Beach. This sandy Beach is two miles long at the end,
whereon is a necke of land called <i>Nahant</i>: It is sixe miles in
circumference; well woodded with Oakes, Pines, and Cedars:
It is beside well watered, having beside the fresh Springs, a
great Pond in the middle; before which is a spacious Marsh.
In this necke is store of good ground, fit for the Plow; but for
the present it is onely used for to put young Cattle in, and
weather-goates, and Swine, to secure them from the
Woolues: a few posts and rayles from the low water-markes
to the shore, keepes out the Woolves, and keepes in the Cattle.
One <i>Blacke William</i>, an <i>Indian</i> Duke, out of his generosity
gave this place in generall to this plantation of <i>Saugus</i>,
so that no other can appropriate it to himselfe.</p>

<p class='c005'>Vpon the South-side of the sandy Beach the Sea beateth,
which is a true prognostication, to presage stormes and foule
weather, and the breaking up of the Frost: For when a
storme hath beene, or is likely to be, it will roare like Thunder,
being heard sixe miles; and after stormes casts up great
store of great Clammes, which the <i>Indians</i> taking out of their
shels, carry home in baskets. On the North-side of this
Bay is two great Marshes, which are made two by a pleasant
River which runnes betweene them. Northward up this River,
goes great store of Alewives, of which they make good
Red Herrings; in so much that they have beene at charges to
<span class='pageno' title='42' id='Page_42'></span>make a wayre, and a Herringhouse, to dry these Herrings in;
the last yeare were dryed some 4 or 5 Last for an experiment,
which proved very good; this is like to prove a great inrichment
to the land, (being a staple commoditie in other Countries)
for there be such innumerable companies in every river,
that I have seene ten thousand taken in two houres by
two men, without any wayre at all, saving a few stones to
stop their passage up the river. There likewise come store
of Basse, which the <i>Indians</i> and <i>English</i> catch with hooke
and line, some fifty or threescore at a tide. At the mouth of
this river runnes up a great creeke into that great Marsh,
which is called <i>Rumny</i> Marsh, which is 4 miles long and 2
miles broad; halfe of it being Marsh ground and halfe upland
grasse, without tree or bush: this Marsh is crossed with divers
creekes, wherein lye great store of Geese, and Duckes.
There be convenient ponds for the planting of Duckcoyes.
Here is likewise belonging to this place divers fresh meddowes,
which afford good grasse and foure spacious ponds
like little lakes, wherein is store of fresh fish: within a mile
of the towne, out of which runnes a curious fresh brooke
that is seldome frozen by reason of the warmenesse of the
water; upon this streame is built a water Milne, and up this
river comes Smelts and frost fish much bigger than a Gudgion.
For wood there is no want, there being store of good
Oakes, Wallnut, Cædar, Aspe, Elme; The ground is very
good, in many places without trees, fit for the plough. In
this plantation is more <i>English</i> tillage, than in all new <i>England</i>,
and <i>Virginia</i> besides; which proved as well as could bee
expected, the corne being very good especially the Barly,
Rye, and Oates.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Salem.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Agowam.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Merrimack river.</i></div>

<p class='c005'>The land affordeth the inhabitants as many rarities as any
place else, and the sea more: the Basse continuing from the
middle of Aprill to <i>Michaelmas</i>, which stayes not above half
that time in the Bay: besides here is a great deale of Rock-cod
and Macrill, insomuch that shoales of Basse have driven
up shoales of Macrill from one end of the sandie beach to
the other, which the inhabitants have gathered up in wheel-barrowes.
The Bay that lyeth before the Towne at a low
<span class='pageno' title='43' id='Page_43'></span>spring tyde, will be all flatts for two miles together, upon
which is great store of Musclebanckes, and Clam bancks, and
Lobsters amongst the rockes and grassie holes. These flatts
make it unnavigable for shippes, yet at high water great
Boates, Loiters, and Pinnaces of 20, and 30 tun, may saile
up to the plantation, but they neede have a skilfull Pilote,
because of many dangerous rockes and foaming breakers,
that lye at the mouth of that Bay. The very aspect of the
place is fortification enough to keepe off an unknowne enemie,
yet may it be fortified at a little charge, being but few
landing places there about, and those obscure. Foure miles
Northeast from <i>Saugus</i> lyeth <i>Salem</i>, which stands on the
middle of a necke of land very pleasantly, having a South river
on the one side, and a North river on the other side: upon
this necke where the most of the houses stand is very bad
and sandie ground, yet for seaven yeares together it hath
brought forth exceeding good corne, by being fished but every
third yeare; in some places is very good ground, and
very good timber, and divers springs hard by the sea side.
Here likewise is store of fish, as Basses, Eeles, Lobsters,
Clammes, &amp;c. Although their land be none of the best, yet
beyond those rivers is a very good soyle, where they have
taken farmes, and get their Hay, and plant their corne; there
they crosse these rivers with small Cannowes, which are
made of whole pine trees, being about two foot &amp; a half over,
and 20. foote long: in these likewise they goe a fowling,
sometimes two leagues to sea; there be more Cannowes in
this towne than in all the whole Patent; every houshould
having a water-house or two. This Towne wants an Alewife
river, which is a great inconvenience; it hath two good harbours,
the one being called Winter, and the other Summer
harbour, which lyeth within <i>Derbies</i> Fort, which place if it
were well fortified, might keepe shippes from landing of
forces in any of those two places. <i>Marvill Head</i> is a place
which lyeth 4 miles full South from <i>Salem</i>, and is a very
convenient place for a plantation, especially for such as will
set upon the trade of fishing. There was made here a ships
loading of fish the last yeare, where still stands the stages,
<span class='pageno' title='44' id='Page_44'></span>and drying scaffolds; here be good harbour for boates, and
safe riding for shippes. <i>Agowamme</i> is nine miles to the
North from <i>Salem</i>, which is one of the most spatious
places for a plantation, being neare the sea, it aboundeth with
fish, and flesh of fowles and beasts, great Meads and
Marshes and plaine plowing grounds, many good rivers and
harbours and no rattle snakes. In a word, it is the best place
but one, which is <i>Merrimacke</i>, lying 8 miles beyond it,
where is a river 20 leagues navigable, all along the river side
is fresh Marshes, in somes places 3 miles broad. In this river
is Sturgeon, Sammon, and Basse, and divers other kinds
of fish. To conclude, the Countrie hath not that which this
place cannot yeeld. So that these two places may containe
twice as many people as are yet in new <i>England</i>: there being
as yet scarce any inhabitants in these two spacious places.
Three miles beyond the river of <i>Merrimacke</i> is the outside
of our Patent for the <i>Massachusetts</i> Bay. These be all the
Townes that were begun, when I came for <i>England</i>, which
was the 15 of August 1633.</p>

<p class='c014'>I have informed you of the Country in generall and of every
plantation in particular, with their commodities and
wherein one excelleth another. Now that I may be every
way faithfull to my reader in this worke, I will as fully and
truely relate to you what is evill, and of most annoyance to
the inhabitants. First: those which bring most prejudice to
their estates are the ravenous Woolves, which destroy the
weaker Cattell, but of these you have heard before: that
which is most injurious to the person and life of man is a
rattle snake which is generally a yard and a halfe long, as
thicke in the middle as the small of a mans legge, she hath a
yellow belly, her backe being spotted with blacke, russet,
<span class='pageno' title='45' id='Page_45'></span>yellow, and greene colours, placed like scales; at her taile is
a rattle, with which she makes a noyse when she is molested,
or when she seeth any approach neere her, her necke seemes
to be no thicker than a mans thumbe yet can she swallow a
Squerill, having a great wide mouth, with teeth as sharpe
as needles, wherewith she biteth such as tread upon her: her
poyson lyeth in her teeth, for she hath no sting. When any
man is bitten by any of these creatures, the poyson spreads so
suddenly through the veines &amp; so runs to the heart, that in one
houre it causeth death, unlesse he hath the Antidote to expell
the poyson, which is a root called snakeweed, which must be
champed, the spittle swallowed, and the root applyed to the
sore; this is present cure against that which would be present
death without it: this weede is ranck poyson, if it be taken by
any man that is not bitten: whosoever is bitten by these snakes
his flesh becomes as spotted as a Leaper until hee be perfectly
cured. It is reported that if the party live that is bitten, the
snake will dye, and if the partie die, the snake will
live. This is a most poysonous and dangerous creature, yet
nothing so bad as the report goes of him in <i>England</i>. For
whereas he is sayd to kill a man with his breath, and that he
can flye, there is no such matter, for he is naturally the most
sleepie and unnimble creature that lives, never offering to
leape or bite any man, if he be not troden on first, and it is
their desire in hot weather to lye in pathes, where the sunne
may shine on them, where they will sleepe so soundly that I
have knowne foure men stride over one of them, and never
awake her; 5 or 6 men have beene bitten by them, which
by using of snake weede were all cured, never any yet losing
his life by them. Cowes have beene bitten, but being cut in
divers places, and this weede thrust into their flesh were cured.
I never heard of any beast that was yet lost by any of
them, saving one Mare. A small switch will easily kill one
of these snakes. In many places of the Countrie there bee
none of them, as at <i>Plimouth</i>, <i>Newtowne</i>, <i>Igowamme</i>, <i>Nahant</i>,
<i>&amp;c.</i> In some places they will live on one side of the river, and
swimming but over the water, as soone as they be come into
the woods, they turne up their yellow bellies and dye. Vp
<span class='pageno' title='46' id='Page_46'></span>into the Countrey westward from the plantations is a high
hill, which is called rattlesnake hill, where there is great
store of these poysonous creatures. There be divers other
kinde of snakes, one whereof is a great long blacke snake,
two yards in length which will glide through the woods very
swiftly; these never doe any hurt, neither doth any other
kinde of snakes molest either man or beast. These creatures
in the winter time creepe into clifts of rockes and into holes
under ground, where they lie close till May or Iune. Here
likewise bee great store of frogs, which in the Spring doe
chirpe and whistle like a bird, and at the latter end of summer
croake like our English frogges. Heere be also toades
which will climbe the topes of high trees where they will
sit croaking, to the wonderment of such as are not acquainted
with them. I never saw any Wormes or Moles,
but pismires and spiders be there. There are likewise troublesome
flies. First there is a wilde Bee or Waspe, which
commonly guards the grape, building her cobweb habitation
amongst the leaves: secondly a great greene flye, not much
unlike our horse flyes in <i>England</i>; they will nippe so sore
that they wil fetch blood either of man or beast, and be most
troublesome where most Cattle be, which brings them from
out of the woods to the houses; this flye continues but
for the Moneth of Iune. The third is a Gurnipper which is
a small blacke fly no bigger than a flea; her biting causeth an
itching upon the hands or face, which provoketh scratching
which is troublesome to some; this fly is busie but in
close mornings or evenings, and continues not above three
weekes, the least winde or heate expells them. The fourth
is a Musketoe which is not unlike to our gnats in <i>England</i>;
In places where there is no thicke woods or Swampes, there
is none or very few. In new Plantations they be troublesome
for the first yeare, but the wood decaying they vanish:
these Flies cannot endure winde, heate or cold, so that these
are onely troublesome in close thicke weather, and against
raine many that be bitten will fall a scratching, whereupon
their faces and hands swell. Others are never troubled with
them at all: those likewise that swell with their biting the
<span class='pageno' title='47' id='Page_47'></span>first yeare, never swell the second: for my owne part I have bin
troubled as much with them or some like them, in the Fen country
of <i>England</i> as ever I was there: Here be the flies that are
called Chantharides, so much esteemed of Chirurgions, with
divers kinds of Butterflies. Thus have you heard of the
worst of the countrey: but some peradventure may say no,
and reply that they have heard that the people have beene
often driven to great wants and extremities; To which I
answer, it is true that some have lived for a certaine time with
a little bread, other without any, yet all this argues nothing
against the countrey in it selfe, but condemnes the folly and
improvidence of such as would venture into so rude and
unmanaged a countrey, without so much provisions as should
have comfortably maintained them in health and strength
till by their labours they had brought the land to yeeld
his fruite. I have my selfe heard some say that they heard
it was a rich land, a brave country, but when they came
there they could see nothing but a few Canvis Boothes &amp; old
houses, supposing at the first to have found walled
townes, fortifications and corne fields, as if townes could
have built themselves, or corne fields have growne of themselves,
without the husbandrie of man. These men missing
of their expectations, returned home and railed against the
Country. Others may object that of late time there hath
beene great want; I denie it not, but looke to the originall,
and tell me from whence it came. The roote of their want
sprung up in <i>England</i>, for many hundreds hearing of the
plenty of the Country, were so much their owne foes and
Countries hindrance, as to come without provision; which
made things both deare and scant: wherefore let none
blame the Country so much as condemne the indiscreetnesse
of such as will needs runne themselves upon hardship. And
I dare further assure any that will carrie provision enough
for a yeare and a halfe, shall not neede to feare want, if he either
be industrious himselfe, or have industrious agents to
mannage his estate and affaires. And whereas many doe disparrage
the land saying a man cannot live without labour, in
that they more disparage and discredit themselves, in giving
<span class='pageno' title='48' id='Page_48'></span>the world occasion to take notice of their droanish disposition,
that would live of the sweate of another mans browes:
surely they were much deceived, or else ill informed, that
ventured thither in hope to live in plenty and idlenesse, both
at a time: and it is as much pitty as he that can worke and
will not, should eate, as it is pitty that he that would worke
and cannot, should fast. I condemne not such therefore as are
now there, and are not able to worke; but I advise for the
future those men that are of weake constitutions to
keepe at home, if their estates cannot maintaine servants.
For all new <i>England</i> must be workers in some kinde: and
whereas it hath beene formerly reported that boyes of
tenne or a twelve yeares of age might doe much
more than get their living, that cannot be, for he must
have more than a boyes head, and no lesse than a mans
strength, that intends to live comfortably; and hee that hath
understanding and Industrie, with a stocke of an hundered
pound, shall live better there, than he shall doe here of twenty
pound <i>per annum</i>. But many I know will say if it be thus,
how comes it to passe then that they are so poore? To
which I answere, that they are poore but in comparison,
compare them with the rich Merchants or great landed men
in <i>England</i>, and then I know they will seeme poore. There is
no probability they should be exceeding rich, because none
of such great estate went over yet; besides, a man of estate
must first scatter before he gather, he must lay out monies
for transporting of servants, and cattle and goods, for houses
and fences and gardens, &amp;c. This may make his purse
seeme light, and to the eye of others seeme a leaking in his
estate, whereas these disbursments are for his future enrichments:
for he being once well seated and quietly setled, his
increase comes in double; and howsoever they are accounted
poore, they are well contented, and looke not so much at
abundance, as a competencie; so little is the poverty of the
Country, that I am perswaded if many in <i>England</i> which
are constrained to begge their bread were there, they would
live better than many doe here, that have money to buy it.
Furthermore when corne is scarse, yet may they have either
<span class='pageno' title='49' id='Page_49'></span>fish or flesh for their labour: and surely that place is not miserably
poore to them that are there, where foure Egges may be had
for a Penny, and a quart of new Milke at the same rate:
Where Butter is sixe-pence a pound, and Cheshire-Cheese
at five pence; sure <i>Middlesex</i> affords <i>London</i> no better
penny-worths. What though there be no such plenty, as to
cry these things in the streetes? yet every day affords these
penny-worths to those that neede them in most places. I dare
not say in all: Can they be very poore, where for foure thousand
soules, there are fifteene hundred head of Cattle, besides
foure thousand Goates, and Swine innumerable? In an
ill sheepe-yeare I have knowne Mutton as deere in <i>Old-England</i>,
and deerer than Goates-flesh is in <i>New-England</i>,
which is altogether as good if fancy be set aside.</p>

<div class="sh">
<i>What provision is to be made for a Iourney at Sea, and
what to carry with us for our use at Land.</i>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Many peradventure at the looking over of these relations,
may have inclinations or resolution for the Voyage,
to whom I wish all prosperity in their undertakings;
although I will use no forcive arguments to perswade any, but
leave them to the relation; yet by way of advice, I would
commend to them a few lines from the Pen of experience. And
because the way to <i>New England</i> is over Sea, it will not be
amisse to give you directions, what is most necessary to bee
carried. Many I suppose, know as well, or better than my
selfe; yet all doe not, to those my directions tend; although every
man have ship-provisions allowed him for his five pound
a man, which is salt Beefe, Porke, salt Fish, Butter, Cheese,
Pease, Pottage, Water-grewell, and such kinde of Victuals,
with good Biskets, and sixe-shilling Beere: yet will it
be necessary, to carry some comfortable refreshing of fresh
victuall. As first, for such as have ability, some Conserves,
and good Clarret Wine to burne at Sea: Or you may have
<span class='pageno' title='50' id='Page_50'></span>it by some of your Vintners or Wine-Coopers burned here, &amp;
put up into vessels, which will keepe much better than other
burnt Wine, it is a very comfortable thing for the stomacke;
or such as are Sea-sicke: Sallet-oyle likewise. Prunes are good
to be stewed; Sugar for many things: White Biskets, and Egs,
and Bacon, Rice, Poultry, and some weather-sheepe to kill
aboard the ship; and fine flowre-baked meates, will keepe about
a weeke or nine dayes at Sea. Iuyce of Lemons well put
up, is good either to prevent or cure the Scurvy. Here it must
not be forgotten to carry small Skillets, or Pipkins, and small
frying-panns, to dresse their victuals in at Sea. For bedding,
so it be easie, and cleanely, and warme, it is no matter how
old or coarse it be for the use of the Sea; and so likewise for
Apparrell, the oldest cloathes be the fittest, with a long
coarse coate, to keepe better things from the pitched ropes
and plankes. Whosoever shall put to Sea in a stoute and well-conditioned
ship, having an honest Master, and loving Sea-men,
shall not neede to feare, but he shall finde as good content
at Sea, as at Land.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is too common with many to feare the Sea more than they
neede, and all such as put to Sea, confesse it to be lesse tedious
than they either feared or expected. A ship at Sea may
well be compared to a Cradle, rocked by a carefull Mothers
hand, which though it be moved up and downe, yet is it
not in danger of falling: So a ship may often be rocked too
and againe upon the troublesome Sea, yet seldome doth it
sinke or over-turne, because it is kept by that carefull hand
of Providence by which it is rocked. It was never knowne
yet, that any ship in that voyage was cast away, or that ever
fell into the Enemies hand.</p>

<p class='c005'>For the health of Passengers it hath beene observed, that
of sixe hundred soules, not above three or foure haue dyed at
Sea: It is probable in such a company, more might have dyed
either by sicknesse or casualities, if they had stayed at home.
For Women, I see not but that they doe as well as men, and
young Children as well as either; having their healths as well
at Sea as at Land: Many likewise which have come with such
foule bodies to Sea, as did make their dayes uncomfortable
<span class='pageno' title='51' id='Page_51'></span>at Land, have beene so purged and clarified at Sea, that they
have beene more healthfull for after-times; their weake appetites
being turned to good stomackes, not onely desiring, but
likewise disgesting such victuals as the Sea affords. Secondly,
for directions for the Countrey, it is not to be feared, but
that men of good estates may doe well there; alwayes provided,
that they goe well accommodated with servants. In which
I would not wish them to take over-many: tenne or twelve
lusty servants being able to mannage an estate of two or three
thousand pound. It is not the multiplicity of many bad servants,
(which presently eates a man out of house and harbour,
as lamentable experience hath made manifest) but the industry
of the faithfull and diligent labourer, that enricheth the
carefull Master; so that he that hath many dronish servants,
shall soone be poore; and he that hath an industrious family,
shall as soone be rich.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now for the incouragement of his men, he must not doe
as many have done, (more through ignorance than desire)
carry many mouthes, and no meate; but rather much meate
for a few mouthes. Want of due maintenance produceth nothing
but a grumbling spirit with a sluggish idlenesse, when
as those servants which be well provided for, goe thorough
their imployments with speede and cheerefulnesse. For meale,
it will be requisite to carry a Hogshead and a halfe, for every
one that is a labourer, to keepe him till hee may receive the
fruite of his owne labours, which will be a yeare and a halfe
after his arrivall, if hee land in <i>May</i> or <i>Iune</i>. He must likewise
carry Malt, Beefe, Butter, Cheese, some Pease,
good Wines, Vinegar, Strong-waters, &amp;c. Whosoever transports
more of these than he himselfe useth, his over-plus being
sold, will yeeld as much profit as any other staple commodity.
Euery man likewise must carry over good store of Apparrell;
for if he come to buy it there, he shall finde it dearer
than in <i>England</i>. Woollen-cloth is a very good comodity, and
Linnen better; as Holland, Lockram, flaxen, Hempen, Callico
stuffes, Linsey-woolsies, and blew Callicoe, greene
Sayes for Housewives aprons, Hats, Bootes, Shooes, good
<i>Irish</i> stockings, which if they be good, are much more serviceable
<span class='pageno' title='52' id='Page_52'></span>than knit-ones. All kind of grocery wares, as Sugar,
Prunes, Raisons, Currants, Honey, Nutmegs, Cloves,
&amp;c. Sope, Candles, and Lamps, &amp;c. All manner of household-stuffe
is very good Trade there, as Pewter and Brasse,
but great Iron-pots be preferred before Brasse, for the use of
that Country. Warming-pannes and Stewing-pannes bee of
necessary use, and good Trafficke there. All manner of Iron-wares,
as all manner of nailes for houses, and all manner of
Spikes for building of Boates, Ships, and fishing stages: all
manner of tooles for Workemen, Hoes for planters, broad
and narrow for setting and weeding; with Axes both broad
and pitching-axes. All manner of Augers, piercing bits,
Whip-saws, Two-handed saws, Froes, both for the riving
of Pailes and Laths, rings for Beetles heads, and Iron-wedges;
though all these be made in the Countrey: (there being
divers Blacke-smiths) yet being a heavy commodity, and
taking but a little stoage, it is cheaper to carry such commodities
out of <i>England</i>. Glasse ought not to be forgotten of any
that desire to benefit themselves, or the Countrey: if it be
well leaded, and carefully pack't up, I know no commodity
better for portage or sayle. Here likewise must not be forgotten
all Vtensils for the Sea, as Barbels, splitting-knives,
Leads, and Cod-hookes, and Lines, Machrill-hooks and lines,
Sharke-hookes, Seanes, or Basse nets, large and strong,
Herring-nets, &amp;c. Such as would eate Fowle, must not forget
their sixe-foote Gunnes, their good Powder and shot, of
all sorts; a great round shot called <i>Bastable</i>-shot, is the best;
being made of a blacker Lead than ordinary shot: Furthermore,
good Pooldavies to make sayles for Boates, Roads,
and Anchors for Boates and Pinnaces, be good; Sea-coale,
Iron, Lead, and Mil-stones, Flints, Ordonances, and
whatsoever a man can conceive is good for the Countrey, that
will lie as Ballast, he cannot be a loser by it. And lest I
should forget a thing of so great importance, no man must
neglect to provide for himselfe, or those belonging to him,
his munition for the defence of himselfe and the Countrey. For
there is no man there that beares a head, but that beares military
Armes: even Boyes of fourteene yeares of age, are
<span class='pageno' title='53' id='Page_53'></span>practised with men in militarie discipline, every three weeks.
Whosoever shall carrie over Drummes and <i>English</i> Colours,
Pattesons, Halberds, Pickes, Muskets, Bandelerous, with
Swords, shall not neede to feare good gaine for them, such
things being wanting in the country: Likewise whatsoever
shall be needefull for fortifications of holds and Castles,
whereby the common enemy may be kept out in future
times, is much desired. They as yet have had no great cause
to feare; but because securitie hath beene the overthrow
of many a new plantation, it is their care according to their
abilities, to secure themselves by fortifications, as well as
they can: Thus having shewed what commodities are most
usefull, it will not be amisse to shew you what men be most
fit for these plantations.</p>

<p class='c005'>First, men of good working, and contriving heads, a well
experienced common wealths man for the good of the body
politicke in matters of advice and counsell, a well skilled
and industrious husbandman, for tillage and improvements
of grounds; an ingenious Carpenter, a cunning Ioyner, a
handie Cooper, such a one as can make strong ware for
the use of the countrie, and a good Brickmaker, a Tyler
and a Smith, a Leather dresser, a Gardner, and a Taylour:
one that hath good skill in the trade of fishing, is of speciall
use, and so is a good Fowler, if there be any that hath skill
in any of these trades, if he can transport himselfe, he needs
not feare but he may improve his time and endeavours to his
owne benefit, and comfort; if any cannot transport himselfe,
he may provide himselfe of an honest master, and so may
doe as well. There is as much freedome and liberty for
servants as in <i>England</i> and more too; a wronged servant
shall have right <i>volens nolens</i> from his injurious master, and
a wronged master shall have right of his injurious servant,
as well as here: Wherefore let no servant be discouraged
from the voyage, that intends it. And now whereas it is
generally reported, that servants and poore men grow rich,
and the masters and Gentrie grow poore; I must needs
confesse that the diligent hand makes rich, and that labouring
men having good store of employments, and as good pay,
<span class='pageno' title='54' id='Page_54'></span>live well, and contentedly; but I cannot perceive that those
that set them aworke are any way impoverished by them;
peradventure they have lesse monie by reason of them, but
never the lesse riches; a mans worke well done being more
beneficiall than his monie, or other dead commodities,
which otherwise would lye by him to no purpose. If any
men be so improvident as to set men about building of Castles
in the Aire, or other unnecessary employments, they may
grow poore; but such as employ labourers about planting
of Corne, building of houses, fenceing in of ground, fishing,
and divers other necessary occasions, shall receive as much
or more by poore mens labours, than those that live in
<i>England</i> doe from the industrie of such as they hire:
Wherefore I doe suppose this to be but the surmisings of
some that are ignorant of the state of the countrey, or else
misinformed by some ill willers to the plantations. Many
objections I know are daily invented, to hinder the proceedings
of these new plantations, which may dampe the unsetled
spirits of such as are not greatly affected with those
undertakings; Some say the <i>Spaniard</i> layes claime to the
whole country, being the first discoverer hereof, and that
he may make invasion upon those parts as well as he hath
done upon S. <i>Christophers</i>, and S. <i>Martins</i>, and those places:
but it doth not follow that because he tooke such places as
lay just in his way to the <i>West Indies</i>, that he should come
thousands of miles with a great Navie to plantations, as yet
not worth the pillage: and when the plantations are growne
noted in the eyes of the common foes for wealth, it is hoped
that when the Bees have Honie in their Hives, they
will have stings in their tailes. Hath not <i>Virginia</i> beene planted
many yeares which is foure hundred miles nearer the
<i>Spaniards</i> course, and yet never met with any affrontments;
so that this scruple smells of feare and pusill-animitie. To
wipe away all groundlesse calumniations, and to answer to
every too curious objections, and frivolous question
(some so simple as not ashamed to aske whether the Sunne
shines there or no) were to run in infinitum; but I hope that
the severall manuscripts and letters, and informations by
<span class='pageno' title='55' id='Page_55'></span>word of mouth from such of our honest countrimen which
daily have recourse unto us, have given full satisfaction to
such as are well willers to the plantations: and for such as
are estranged to it in affection, if every word that hath
beene eyther writ or spoken were a forcive argument, yet
would it be too little to steddie their beleefe in any one particular
concerning the country. Some are nimble eared to
heare faults, and so ready tongued to publish them, yea often
times with strained constructions; a false asseveration usually
winneth more beleefe than two verifying negatives can
resettle: Some there are who count with <i>Claudian</i> that it is
an incomparable happinesse to have their birth, life &amp; burying
in the same place: these are never likely to remove further
than the shell of their owne countrie. But because there are
some noble spirits that devote their states, and their persons,
to the common good of their king and country, I have
therefore for their direction and delight made this relation:
For as the end of my travell was observation, so I desire the
end of my observation may tend to the information of
others: As I have observed what I have seene, and written
what I have observed, so doe I desire to publish what I
have written, desiring it may be beneficiall to posteritie;
and if any man desire to fill himselfe at that fountaine, from
whence this tasting cup was taken, his owne experience
shall tell him as much as I have here related, and thus I passe
from the country as it stands to the <i>English</i>, and come to discourse
how it stands to the old Natives, and they to it, as
followeth.</p>

The country as it is in relation to the <i>Indians</i>,
is divided as it were into Shires, every severall
division being swayde by a severall
king. The <i>Indians</i> to the East and North
east, bearing the name of <i>Churchers</i>, and
<i>Tarrenteenes</i>. These in the Southerne parts
be called <i>Pequants</i>, and <i>Narragansets</i>; those who are seated
West-ward be called, <i>Connectacuts</i>, and <i>Mowhacks</i>: Our
<span class='pageno' title='57' id='Page_57'></span><i>Indians</i> that live to the North-ward of them be called <i>Aberginians</i>,
who before the sweeping Plague, were an Inhabitant
not fearing, but rather scorning the confrontments of
such as now count them but the scumme of the country, and
would soone roote them out of their native possessions were
it not for the <i>English</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>These are a cruell bloody people, which were wont to come
downe upon their poore neighbours with more than bruitish
savagenesse, spoyling of their Corne, burning their houses,
slaying men, ravishing women, yea very Caniballs
they were, sometimes eating on a man one part after another
before his face, and while yet living; in so much that the
very name of a <i>Mowhack</i> would strike the heart of a poore
<i>Abergenian</i> dead, were there not hopes at hand of releefe
from <i>English</i> to succour them: For these inhumane homicides
confesse that they dare not meddle with a white faced
man, accompanyed with his hot mouth'd weapon. These
<i>Indians</i> be a people of a tall stature, of long grimme visages,
slender wasted, and exceeding great armes and thighes,
wherein they say their strength lyeth; and this I rather beleeve
because an honest gentleman told me, upon his knowledge,
that he saw one of them with a fillippe with his finger
kill a dogge, who afterward flead him and sod him, and
eate him to his dinner. They are so hardie that they can
eate such things as would make other <i>Indians</i> sicke to looke
upon, being destitute of fish and flesh, they suffice hunger
and maintaine nature with the use of vegetatives; but that
which they most hunt after, is the flesh of man; their custome
is if they get a stranger neere their habitations, not to
butcher him immediately, but keeping him in as good plight
as they can, feeding him with the best victualls they have.
As a neere neighbouring <i>Indian</i> assured me, who found what
he had spoke true by a lamentable experience, still wearing
the cognizance of their cruelty on his naked arme, who being
taken by them eate of their foode, lodged in their beds,
nay he was brought forth every day, to be new painted, piped
unto, and hem'd in with a ring of bare skinned morris
dancers, who presented their antiques before him: In a
<span class='pageno' title='58' id='Page_58'></span>word, when they had sported enough about this walking
Maypole, a rough hewne satyre cutteth a gobbit of flesh
from his brawnie arme, eating it in his view, searing it with
a firebrand, least the blood should be wasted before the morning,
at the dawning wherof they told him they would make
an end as they had begun; hee answered that he cared as little
for their threats as they did for his life, not fearing death; whereupon
they led him bound into a <i>Wigwam</i>, where he sate as a
condemned Prisoner, grating his teeth for anguish being for
the present so hampered, and the next day to be entombed in
so many living sepulchers; he extends his strength to the utmost,
breaketh the bands from his hands, and loosing the
cords from his feete, thought at once to be revenged for the
flesh of his arme, and finding a hatchet, layes one with an
arme of revenge to the unliving of ten men at first onset,
afterward taking the opportunitie of the dead of
night, fled through the woods and came to his native home,
where he still lives to rehearse his happie escapall; of the
rest of their inhumane cruelties let the <i>Dutchmen</i>, (who live
among them) testifie, as likewise the cruell manner of leading
their prisoners captive, whom they doe not onely pinnion
with sharpe thongs, but likewise bore holes through their
hamstrings, through which they thread a cord coupling
ten or a dozen men together.</p>

<p class='c005'>These <i>Indians</i> be more desperate in warres than the other
<i>Indians</i>; which proceeds not onely from the fiercenesse of
their natures, but also in that they know themselves to be
better armed and weaponed; all of them wearing sea horse
skinnes and barkes of trees, made by their Art as impenitrable
it is thought as steele, wearing head peeces of the same,
under which they march securely and undantedly, running,
and fiercely crying out, <i>Hadree Hadree succomee succomee</i>
we come we come to sucke your blood, not fearing the feathered
shafts of the strong-armed bow-men, but like unruly
headstrong stallions beate them downe with their right
hand Tamahaukes, and left hand Iavelins, being all the
weapons which they use, counting bowes a cowardly fight.
<i>Tamahaukes</i> be staves of two foote and a halfe long, and a
<span class='pageno' title='59' id='Page_59'></span>knob at one end as round and bigge as a footeball: a Iavelin
is a short speare, headed with sharpe sea-horse teeth; one
blow or thrust with these strange weapons, will not neede a
second to hasten death, from a <i>Mowhackes</i> arme. I will conclude
this discourse concerning the <i>Mowhackes</i>, in a tragicall
rehearsall of one of their combates. A <i>Sagamore</i> inhabiting
neere these Canniballs, was so dayly annoyed with
their injurious inhumanitie, that he must either become a
tributarie subject to their tyrannie, or release himselfe from
thraldome by the stroke of warre, which he was unable to
wage of himselfe: wherefore with faire entreaties, plausible
perswasions, forcive arguments, and rich presents he sent
to other <i>Sagamores</i>, he procured so many souldiers as summed
with his owne, made his forces sixe thousand strong;
with the which he resolutely marched towards his enemies,
intending either to win the horse or loose the saddle. His
enemies having heard of his designes, plotted how to confront
him in his enterprize, and overthrow him by trecherie;
which they thus attempted; knowing their enemies
were to swimme over a muddie river, they divided
their bands lying in ambush on both sides the river, waiting
his approach, who suspected no danger looking for
nothing but victory; but immediately they were invyroned
with their unexpected foes, in their greatest disadvantage:
for being in the water, shoote they could not,
for swimming was their action; and when they came to
the side, they could not runne away, for their feete
stucke fast in the mudde, and their adversaries impaled
them about, clubbing and darting all that attained the
shore; so that all were killed and captived, saving three
who swimming further under the waters (like the
Ducke that escapeth the Spannell by diving) untill they
were out of sight of their blood thirstie foes, recovered
the shoare creeping into the thickets, from whence after
a little breathing and resting of their weary limbes,
they marched through the woods and arrived at their
owne homes, relating to their inquisitive survivers the
sadde event of their warre, who a long time after deplored
<span class='pageno' title='60' id='Page_60'></span>the death of their friends, still placing the remembrance
of that day in the Callender of their mishappes.</p>

<i>Of the </i>Tarrenteenes<i> or the </i>Indians<i> inhabiting
Eastward.</i>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The <i>Tarrenteenes</i> saving that they eate not mans flesh,
are little lesse salvage, and cruell than these Canniballs:
our <i>Indians</i> doe feare them as their deadly enemies; for so
many of them as they meete they kill. About 2 yeares agoe,
our <i>Indians</i> being busie about their accustomed huntings,
not suspecting them so neere their owne liberties, were on
the suddaine surprized by them; some being slaine, the rest
escaping to their <i>English Asylum</i>, whither they durst not
pursue them; their <i>Sagamore</i> was wounded by an arrow, but
presently cured by <i>English</i> Chirurgery. These <i>Indians</i> are
the more insolent, by reason they have guns which they dayly
trade for with the <i>French</i>, (who will sell his eyes as
they say, for beaver:) but these doe them more credit than
service; for having guns they want powder, or if they have
that, they want shot, something or other being alwayes
wanting; so that they use them for little, but to salute coasting
boates that come to trade, who no sooner can anchor in
any harbour; but they present them with a vollie of shot,
asking for sacke and strong liquors, which they so much
love since the <i>English</i> used to trade it with them, that
they will scarse trade for any thing else, lashing out into
excessive abuse, first taught by the example of some of
our <i>English</i> who to uncloathe them of their beaver
coates, clad them with the infection of swearing and
drinking, which was never in fashion with them before,
it being contrary to their nature to guzell downe
strong drinke, or use so much as to sippe of strong-waters, vntill
our bestiall example and dishonest incitation brought
them to it; from which I am sure hath sprung many evill consequents,
<span class='pageno' title='61' id='Page_61'></span>as disorder, quarrels, wrongs, unconscionable and
forcive wresting of Beaver and Wampompeage: and from over-flowing
Cups there hath beene a proceeding to revenge,
murther and over-flowing of blood. As witnesse Maister
<i>Wayes</i> Boate, which they sunke with stones after they had killed
his son, with three more: buzzing the <i>English</i> in the eares,
that they see it bulged against the rockes, and the men drowned
in the beating surges: but afterwards being betrayed, as
many as were caught, were hanged. Another who was situated
on <i>Richmonds</i> Iland, living as he list amongst them, making
his couetous corrupt will his law; after many abuses, was
with his family one evening treacherously murthered, under
a faire pretence of trade; so that these that lived beside the
Law of God, and their King, and the light of Nature, dyed by
their hands that car'd neither for God, King, nor Nature. Take
these <i>Indians</i> in their own trimme and naturall disposition,
and they be reported to be wise, lofty-spirited, constant in
friendship to one another; true in their promise, and more industrious
than many others.</p>

<i>Of the </i>Pequants<i> and </i>Narragansets<i>, </i>Indians<i> inhabiting

</div>

<p class='c014'>The <i>Pequants</i> be a stately warlike people, of whom I
never heard any misdemeanour; but that they were iust
and equall in their dealings; not treacherous either to their
Country-men, or <i>English</i>: Requiters of courtesies, affable
towards the <i>English</i>. Their next neighbours the <i>Narragansets</i>,
be at this present the most numerous people in those
parts, the most rich also, and the most industrious; being the
store-house of all such kind of wild Merchandize as is amongst
them. These men are the most curious minters of their <i>Wampompeage</i>
and <i>Mowhakes</i>, which they forme out of the inmost
wreaths of Periwinkle-shels. The Northerne, Easterne, and
Westerne <i>Indians</i> fetch all their Coyne from these Southerne
<span class='pageno' title='62' id='Page_62'></span>Mint-masters. From hence they have most of their curious
Pendants &amp; Bracelets; from hence they have their great stone-pipes,
which wil hold a quarter of an ounce of Tobacco, which
they make with steele-drils and other instruments; such is their
ingenuity &amp; dexterity, that they can imitate the <i>English</i> mold
so accurately, that were it not for matter and colour it were
hard to distinguish them; they make them of greene, &amp; sometimes
of blacke stone; they be much desired of our <i>English</i>
Tobaconists, for their rarity, strength, handsomnesse, and
coolnesse. Hence likewise our <i>Indians</i> had their pots wherein
they used to seeth their victuals before they knew the use of
Brasse. Since the <i>English</i> came, they have employed most of
their time in catching of Beavers, Otters, and Musquashes,
which they bring downe into the Bay, returning backe loaded
with <i>English</i> commodities, of which they make a double
profit, by selling them to more remote <i>Indians</i>, who are
ignorant at what cheape rates they obtaine them, in comparison
of what they make them pay, so making their neighbours
ignorance their enrichment. Although these be populous,
yet I never heard they were desirous to take in hand
any martiall enterprize, or expose themselves to the uncertaine
events of warre: wherefore the <i>Pequants</i> call them
Women-like men; but being uncapable of a jeare, they rest
secure under the conceit of their popularitie, and seeke rather
to grow rich by industrie, than famous by deeds of
Chevalry. But to leave strangers, and come to declare what
is experimentally knowne of the <i>Indians</i>, amongst whom

    <div><i>Of the </i>Aberginians<i> or </i>Indians<i> Northward.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>First of their Stature, most of them being betweene five
or six foote high, straight bodied, strongly composed,
smooth skinned, merry countenanced, of complexion something
more swarthy than <i>Spaniards</i>, black hair'd, high foreheaded,
blacke ey'd, out-nosed, broad shouldred, brawny
<span class='pageno' title='63' id='Page_63'></span>arm'd, long and slender handed, out brested, small wasted,
lanke bellied, well thighed, flat kneed, handsome growne
leggs, and small feete: In a word, take them when the blood
briskes in their veines, when the flesh is on their backs, and
marrow in their bones, when they frolick in their antique
deportments and <i>Indian</i> postures; and they are more amiable
to behold (though onely in <i>Adams</i> livery) than many a
compounded phantasticke in the newest fashion. It may
puzzle beliefe, to conceive how such lustie bodies should
have their rise and daily supportment from so slender a fostering;
their houses being meane, their lodging as homely,
commons scant, their drinke water, and Nature their best
cloathing; in them the old proverbe may well be verified:
(<i>Natura paucis contenta</i>) for though this be their daily portion,
they still are healthfull and lusty. I have beene in many
places, yet did I never see one that was borne either in redundance
or defect a monster, or any that sickneffe had deformed,
or casualitie made decrepit, saving one that had a
bleared eye, and an other that had a wenne on his cheeke.
The reason is rendred why they grow so proportionable,
and continue so long in their vigour (most of them being 50
before a wrinkled brow or gray haire betray their age) is
because they are not brought downe with suppressing labour,
vexed with annoying cares, or drowned in the excessive
abuse of overflowing plenty, which oftentimes kils
them more than want, as may appeare in them. For when
they change their bare <i>Indian</i> commons for the plenty of
<i>Englands</i> fuller diet, it is so contrary to their stomacks, that
death or a desperate sicknesse immediately accrews, which
makes so few of them desirous to see <i>England</i>. Their swarthinesse
is the Sun's livery, for they are borne faire. Their
smooth skins proceede from the often anoynting of their
bodies with the oyle of fishes, and the fat of Eagles, with
the grease of Rackoones, which they hold in summer, the
best antidote to keepe their skinne from blistering with the
scorching Sunne; and it is their best armour against the Musketoes,
the surest expeller of the hairy excrement, and stops
the pores of their bodies against the nipping winters cold.
<span class='pageno' title='64' id='Page_64'></span>Their black haire is naturall, yet it is brought to a more jetty
colour by oyling, dying, and daily dressing. Sometimes
they weare it very long, hanging down in a loose dishevel'd
womanish manner; otherwhile tied up hard and short like a
horse taile, bound close with a fillet, which they say makes it
grow the faster: they are not a little phantasticall or custom-sick
in this particular; their boyes being not permitted to
weare their haire long till sixteene yeares of age, and then
they must come to it by degrees; some being cut with a
long foretop, a long locke on the crowne, one of each side
of his head, the rest of his haire being cut even with the
scalpe: the young men and souldiers weare their haire long
on the one side, the other side being cut short like a screw;
other cuts they have as their fancie befooles them, which
would torture the wits of a curious Barber to imitate. But
though they be thus wedded to the haire of their head, you
cannot wooe them to weare it on their chinnes, where it no
sooner growes, but it is stubbed up by the rootes, for they
count it as an unuseful, cumbersome, and opprobrious excrement,
insomuch as they call him an <i>English</i> mans bastard
that hath but the appearance of a beard, which some have
growing in a staring fashion, like the beard of a cat, which
makes them the more out of love with them, choosing rather
to have no beards than such as should make them ridiculous.</p>

<i>Of their Apparell, Ornaments, Paintings, and other artificiall
deckings.</i>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Now these naked bodies may seeme too weake to with-stand
the assaulting heat of their parching Summers,
and the piercing cold of the icie Winters, or it may be surmised
that these earthly fabricks should be wasted to nothing
by the tempestuous dashings of wind-driven raines,
having neither that which may warme within, or shelter
without; yet these things they looke not after, saving a
<span class='pageno' title='65' id='Page_65'></span>paire of <i>Indian</i> Breeches to cover that which modesty commands
to be hid, which is but a peece of cloth a yard and a
halfe long, put betweene their groinings, tied with a snakes
skinne about their middles, one end hanging downe with a
flap before, the other like a taile behinde. In the Winter
time the more aged of them weare leather drawers, in forme
like <i>Irish</i> trouses, fastned under their girdle with buttons;
they weare shooes likewise of their owne making cut out
of a Mooses hide, many of them weare skinnes about them,
in forme of an <i>Irish</i> mantle, and of these some be Beares
skinnes, Mooses skinnes, and Beaver skinnes sewed together,
Otter skinnes, and Rackoone skinnes; most of them
in the Winter having his deepe furr'd Cat skinne, like a long
large muffe, which hee shifts to that arme which lieth most
exposed to the winde; thus clad, hee busles better through
a world of cold in a frost-paved wildernesse, than the furred
Citizen in his warmer Stoave. If their fancie drive them to
trade, they choose rather a good course blanket, thorough
which they cannot see, interposing it betweene the sunne
and them; or a piece of broade cloth, which they use for a
double end, making it a coate by day, and a covering by
night; they love not to be imprisoned in our <i>English</i> fashion:
they love their owne dogge fashion better (of shaking their
eares, and being ready in a moment) than to spend time in
dressing them, though they may as well spare it as any men
I know, having little else to doe. But the chiefe reasons they
render why they will not conforme to our <i>English</i> apparell,
are, because their women cannot wash them when they bee
soyled, and their meanes will not reach to buy new when
they have done with their old; and they confidently beleeve,
the <i>English</i> will not be so liberall as to furnish them upon
gifture: therefore they had rather goe naked than be lousie,
and bring their bodies out of their old tune, making them
more tender by a new acquired habit, which poverty would
constraine them to leave: although they be thus poore, yet
is there in them the sparkes of naturall pride, which appeares
in their longing desire after many kinde of ornaments,
wearing pendants in their eares, as formes of birds,
<span class='pageno' title='66' id='Page_66'></span>beasts, and fishes, carved out of bone, shels, and stone, with
long bracelets of their curious wrought wampompeage and
mowhackees, which they put about their necks and loynes;
these they count a rare kinde of decking; many of the better
sort bearing upon their cheekes certaine pourtraitures of
beasts, as Beares, Deares, Mooses, Wolves, &amp;c. some of fowls,
as of Eagles, Hawkes, &amp;c. which be not a superficiall painting,
but a certaine incision, or else a raising of their skin by
a small sharpe instrument, under which they conveigh a certain
kind of black unchangeable inke, which makes the desired
forme apparent and permanent. Others have certaine
round Impressions downe the outside of their armes and
brests, in forme of mullets or spur-rowels, which they imprint
by searing irons: whether these be foiles to illustrate
their unparalleld beauty (as they deeme it) or Armes to blazon
their antique Gentilitie, I cannot easily determine: but a
Sagamore with a Humberd in his eare for a pendant, a black
hawke on his <i>occiput</i> for his plume, Mowhackees for his
gold chaine, good store of Wampompeage begirting his
loynes, his bow in his hand, his quiver at his back with six
naked <i>Indian</i> spatterlashes at his heeles for his guard,
thinkes himselfe little inferiour to the great <i>Cham</i>; hee will
not stick to say, hee is all one with King <i>Charles</i>. He thinkes
hee can blow downe Castles with his breath, and conquer
kingdomes with his conceit. This <i>Pompey</i> can endure no
equall, till one dayes adverse lotterie at their game (called
<i>Puimme</i>) metamorphize him into a <i>Codrus</i>, robbing him
of his conceited wealth, leaving him in minde and riches equall
with his naked attendants, till a new taxation furnish

<i>Of their dyet, cookery, meale-times, and hospitality at
their Kettles.</i>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Having done with their most needfull cloathings and
ornamentall deckings; may it please you to feast your
<span class='pageno' title='67' id='Page_67'></span>eyes with their belly-timbers, which I suppose would be
but <i>stibium</i> to weake stomacks as they cooke it, though never
so good of it selfe. In Winter-time they have all manner
of fowles of the water and of the land, &amp; beasts of the land
and water, pond-fish, with Catharres and other rootes, <i>Indian</i>
beanes and Clamms. In the Summer they have all manner
of Sea-fish, with all sorts of Berries. For the ordering of
their victuals, they boile or roast them, having large Kettles
which they traded for with the <i>French</i> long since, and doe
still buy of the <i>English</i> as their neede requires, before they
had substantiall earthen pots of their owne making. Their
spits are no other than cloven sticks sharped at one end to
thrust into the ground; into these cloven sticks they thrust
the flesh or fish they would have rosted, behemming a
round fire with a dozen of spits at a time, turning them as
they see occasion. Some of their scullerie having dressed
these homely cates, presents it to his guests, dishing it up
in a rude manner, placing it on the verdent carpet of the
earth which Nature spreads them, without either trenchers,
napkins, or knives, upon which their hunger-sawced stomacks
impatient of delayes, fals aboard without scrupling
at unwashed hands, without bread, salt, or beere: lolling on
the Turkish fashion, not ceasing till their full bellies leave
nothing but emptie platters: they seldome or never make
bread of their <i>Indian</i> corne, but seeth it whole like beanes,
eating three or foure cornes with a mouthfull of fish or
flesh, sometimes eating meate first, and cornes after, filling
chinkes with their broth. In Summer, when their corne
is spent, Isquoutersquashes is their best bread, a fruite like a
young Pumpion. To say, and to speake paradoxically, they
be great eaters, and yet little meate-men; when they visit
our <i>English</i>, being invited to eate, they are very moderate,
whether it be to shew their manners, or for shamefastnesse,
I know not; but at home they will eate till their bellies
stand south, ready to split with fulnesse; it being their fashion
to eate all at some times, and sometimes nothing at all in
two or three dayes, wise Providence being a stranger to
their wilder wayes: they be right Infidels, neither caring
<span class='pageno' title='68' id='Page_68'></span>for the morrow, or providing for their owne families; but
as all are fellowes at foot-ball, so they all meete friends at
the kettle, saving their Wives, that dance a Spaniell-like attendance
at their backes for their bony fragments. If their
imperious occasions cause them to travell, the best of their
victuals for their journey is <i>Nocake</i>, (as they call it) which
is nothing but <i>Indian</i> Corne parched in the hot ashes; the
ashes being sifted from it, it is afterward beaten to powder,
and put into a long leatherne bag, trussed at their backe like a
knapsacke; out of which they take thrice three spoonefulls a
day, dividing it into three meales. If it be in Winter, and
Snow be on the ground, they can eate when they please, stopping
Snow after their dusty victuals, which otherwise would
feed them little better than a Tiburne halter. In Summer they must
stay till they meete with a Spring or Brooke, where they may
have water to prevent the imminent danger of choaking.
With this strange <i>viaticum</i> they will travell foure or five daies
together, with loads fitter for Elephants than men. But
though they can fare so hardly abroad, at home their chaps
must walke night and day as long as they have it. They keepe
no set meales, their store being spent, they champe on the
bit, till they meete with fresh supplies, either from their owne
endeavours, or their wives industry, who trudge to the <i>Clam-bankes</i>
when all other meanes faile. Though they be sometimes
scanted, yet are they as free as Emperours, both to
their Country-men and <i>English</i>, be he stranger, or neare acquaintance;
counting it a great discourtesie, not to eate of
their high-conceited delicates, and sup of their un-oat-meal'd
broth, made thicke with Fishes, Fowles, and Beasts boyled
all together; some remaining raw, the rest converted by
over-much seething to a loathed mash, not halfe so good as
<i>Irish Boniclapper</i>.</p>

<i>Of their dispositions and good qualifications, as friendship,
constancy, truth, and affability.</i>
</div>

<p class='c014'>To enter into a serious discourse concerning the naturall
conditions of these <i>Indians</i>, might procure admiration
from the people of any civilized Nations, in regard of their
civility and good natures. If a Tree may be judged by his
fruite, and dispositions calculated by exteriour actions; then
may it be concluded, that these <i>Indians</i> are of affable, courteous,
and well disposed natures, ready to communicate the
best of their wealth to the mutuall good of one another; and
the lesse abundance they have, to manifest their entire friendship;
so much the more perspicuous is their love, in that they
are as willing to part with their Mite in poverty, as treasure in
plenty. As he that kills a Deere, sends for his friends, and
eates it merrily: So he that receives but a piece of bread from
an <i>English</i> hand, parts it equally betweene himselfe and his
comerades, and eates it lovingly. In a word, a friend can command
his friend, his house, and whatsoever is his, (saving his
Wife) and have it freely: And as they are love-linked thus in
common courtesie, so are they no way sooner dis-joynted than
by ingratitude; accounting an ungratefull person a double robber
of a man, not onely of his courtesie, but of his thankes
which he might receive of another for the same proffered, or
received kindnesse. Such is their love to one another, that
they cannot endure to see their Countrey-men wronged, but
will stand stiffely in their defence: plead strongly in their behalfe,
and justifie one anothers integrities in any warrantable
action. If it were possible to recount the courtesies they have
shewed the <i>English</i>, since their first arrivall in those parts, it
would not onely steddy beleefe, that they are a loving people,
but also winne the love of those that never saw them, and
wipe off that needelesse feare that is too deepely rooted in the
conceits of many, who thinke them envious, and of such
rankerous and inhumane dispositions, that they will one day
<span class='pageno' title='70' id='Page_70'></span>make an end of their <i>English</i> inmates. The worst indeede
may be surmised, but the <i>English</i> hitherto have had little
cause to suspect them, but rather to be convinced of their
trustinesse, seeing they have as yet beene the disclosers of all
such treacheries as have bin practised by other <i>Indians</i>. And
whereas once there was a proffer of an universall League amongst
all the <i>Indians</i> in those parts, to the intent that they
might all joyne in one united force, to extirpate the <i>English</i>,
our <i>Indians</i> refused the motion, replying, they had rather be
servants to the <i>English</i>, of whom they were confident to receive
no harme, and from whom they had received so many
favours, and assured good testimonies of their love, than equals
with them, who would cut their throates upon the least
offence, and make them the shambles of their cruelty. Furthermore,
if any roaving ships be upon the coasts, and chance
to harbour either East-ward, North-ward, or South-ward in
any unusuall Port, they will giue us certaine intelligence of
her burthen and forces, describing their men either by language
or features; which is a great priviledge and no small advantage.
Many wayes hath their advice and endeavour beene
advantagious unto us; they being our first instructers for the
planting of their <i>Indian</i> Corne, by teaching us to cull out the
finest seede, to observe the fittest season, to keepe distance
for holes, and fit measure for hills, to worme it, and weede it;
to prune it, and dresse it as occasion shall require.</p>

<p class='c005'>These <i>Indians</i> be very hospitable, insomuch that when the
<i>English</i> have trauelled forty, fifty, or threescore miles into
the Countrey, they have entertained them into their houses,
quartered them by themselves in the best roomes, providing
the best victuals they could, expressing their welcome in as
good termes as could be expected from their slender breeding;
shewing more love than complement, not grumbling for a
fortnights or three weekes tarrying; but rather caring to provide
accommodation correspondent to their <i>English</i> custome.
The doubtfull traveller hath oftentimes beene much beholding
to them for their guidance thorow the unbeaten Wildernesse:
my selfe in this particular can doe no lesse in the due acknowledgment
of their love, than speake their commendations, who
<span class='pageno' title='71' id='Page_71'></span>with two more of my associates bending our course to new
<i>Plimouth</i>, lost our way, being deluded by a misleading path
which we still followed, being as we thought too broad for
an <i>Indian</i> path (which seldome is broader than a Cart's
rutte) but that the dayly concourse of <i>Indians</i> from the
<i>Narragansets</i> who traded for shooes, wearing them homewards
had made this <i>Indian</i> tract like an <i>English</i> walke, and
had rear'd up great stickes against the trees, and marked
the rest with their hatchets in the <i>English</i> fashion, which
begat in us a security of our wrong way to be right, when indeed
there was nothing lesse: The day being gloomy and
our compasses at home, we travelled hard till night to lesse
purpose than if we had sat still, not gaining an inch of our
journey for a dayes travell: but happily wee arrived at an
<i>Indian Wigwamme</i>, where we were informed of our misprision,
and invited to a homely lodging, feasted with the haunch
of a fat Deere, and the ensuing morning the son of my naked
hoast, for a peece of Tobacco, and a foure penny whittle, tooke
the clew of his traveling experience, conducting us through
the strange labyrinth of unbeaten bushy wayes in the woody
wildernesse twentie miles to our desired harbour.</p>

<p class='c005'>A second demonstration of their love in this kind may appeare
in a passage of the same nature. An unexperienced
wood man ranging in the woods for Deere, traveled so farre
beyond his knowledge, till he could not tell how to get
out of the wood for trees, but the more he sought to direct
himselfe out, the more he ranne himselfe in, from the
home he most desired; the night came upon him preventing
his walking, and the extremitie of cold seasing upon
his right foote for want of warming motion, deprived him
of the use thereof, so that he could not remoove farther
than his snowie bed, but had there ended his dayes, had not
sixe commiserating <i>Indians</i>, who heard of his wandering,
found him out by diligent search, being almost dead with
despaire and cold: but after they had conquered his despaire
with the assurance of his safe conduction to his habitation,
and expelled the cold by the infusion of strong waters which
they brought for the same purpose; they framed a thing like
<span class='pageno' title='72' id='Page_72'></span>a hand barrow and carryed this selfe-helpelesse person on
their bare-shoulders twelve miles to his residence: many other
wandring benighted coasters have beene kindly entertained
into their habitations, where they have rested and reposed
themselves more securely than if they had beene in
some blind obscure old <i>Englands</i> Inne, being the next day directed
in their right way: many lazie boyes that have runne
away from their masters, have beene brought home by these
ranging foresters, who are as well acquainted with the craggy
mountaines, and the pleasant vales, the stately woods, and
swampie groves, the spacious ponds, and swift running
rivers, and can distinguish them by their names as perfectly,
and finde them as presently, as the experienced Citizen
knows how to finde out Cheape-side crosse, or <i>London</i>
stone. Such is the wisedome and pollicie of these
poore men, that they will be sure to keepe correspondence
with our <i>English</i> Magistrates, expressing their love
in the execution of any service they command them, so far
as lyes in their power, as may appeare in this one particular.
A certaine man having layd himselfe open to the Kings
lawes, fearing attachment, conviction, and consequently execution:
sequestred himselfe from the honest societie of his
neighbours, betaking himselfe unto the obscure thickets of
the wildernesse, where hee lived for a time undiscovered,
till the <i>Indians</i> who leave no place unsearched for Deere,
found out his haunt, and having taken notice by diverse discourses
concerning him, how that it was the governers desire
to know where he was; they thought it a part of their
service to certifie him where he kept his rendevouze, who
thereupon desired if they could to direct men to him for his
attachment, but he had shifted his dwelling, and could not
be found for the present, yet he was after seene by other <i>Indians</i>,
but being double pistold, and well sworded, they feared
to approach so neere him as to grapple with him:
wherefore they let him alone till his owne necessary businesse
cast him upon them; for having occasion to crosse a river,
he came to the side thereof, where was an <i>Indian Cannow</i>, in
which the <i>Indians</i> were to crosse the river themselves, hee
<span class='pageno' title='73' id='Page_73'></span>vauntingly commanded wastage; which they willingly
graunted, but withall plotting how they might take him
prisoner, which they thus effected; having placed him in the
midship of their ticklish wherrie, they lanched forth into
the deepe, causing the capering <i>Cannow</i> to cast out her
combersome ballast into the liquid water; which swomme
like a stone, and now the water having dank't his pistoles,
and lost his <i>Spanish</i> progge in the bottome, the <i>Indians</i>
swomme him out by the chinne to the shore, where having
dropt himselfe a little dry, he began to bluster out a storme
of rebellious resistance, till they becalmed his pelting chafe
with their pelting of pibles at him, afterward leading him as
they list to the governour. These people be of a kinde and
affable disposition, yet are they very warie with whom they
strike hands in friendshippe: nothing is more hatefull
to them than a churlish disposition, so likewise is dissimulation:
he that speakes seldome, and opportunely, being
as good as his word, is the onely man they love. The <i>Spaniard</i>
they say is all one <i>Aramouse</i> (<i>viz.</i> all one as a dog) the
<i>Frenchman</i> hath a good tongue, but a false heart: The <i>English</i>
man all one speake, all one heart; wherefore they more
approve of them than of any Nation: garrulitie is much
condemned of them, for they utter not many words, speake
seldome, and then with such gravitie as is pleasing to the
eare: such as understand them not, desire yet to heare their
emphaticall expressions, and lively action; such is the milde
temper of their spirits that they cannot endure objurgations,
or scoldings. An <i>Indian Sagamore</i> once hearing an <i>English</i>
woman scold with her husband, her quicke utterance
exceeding his apprehension, her active lungs thundering in
his eares, expelled him the house; from whence he went to
the next neighbour, where he related the unseemelinesse of
her behaviour; her language being strange to him, hee expressed
it as strangely, telling them how she cryed Nannana
Nannana Nannana Nan, saying he was a great foole to give
her the audience, and no correction for usurping his charter,
and abusing him by her tongue. I have beene amongst diverse
of them, yet did I never see any falling out amongst them,
not so much as crosse words, or reviling speeches,
<span class='pageno' title='74' id='Page_74'></span>which might provoke to blowes. And whereas it is the
custome of many people in their games, if they see the dice
runne crosse or their cards not answere their expectations:
what cursing and swearing, what imprecations, and raylings,
fightings and stabbings oftentimes proceede from their
testy spleene. How doe their blustering passions, make the
place troublesome to themselves and others? But I have
knowne when foure of these milder spirits have sit downe
staking their treasures, where they have plaied foure and
twentie houres, neither eating drinking or sleeping in the
Interim; nay which is most to be wondered at, not quarreling,
but as they came thither in peace so they depart in
peace: when he that had lost all his <i>wampompeage</i>, his
house, his kettle, his beaver, his hatchet, his knife, yea all
his little all, having nothing left but his naked selfe, was as
merry as they that won it: so in sports of activitie at footeball
though they play never so fiercely to outward appearance,
yet anger-boyling blood never streames in their cooler
veines, if any man be throwne he laughes out his foyle,
there is no seeking of revenge, no quarreling, no bloody
noses, scratched faces, blacke eyes, broken shinnes, no brused
members, or crushed ribs, the lamentable effects of
rage; but the goale being wonne, the goods on the one side
lost; friends they were at the footeball, and friends they must
meete at the kettle. I never heard yet of that <i>Indian</i> that
was his neighbours homicide or vexation by his malepart,
saucy, or uncivill tongue: laughter in them is not common,
seldome exceeding a smile, never breaking out into such a
lowd laughter, as doe many of our <i>English</i>. Of all things
they love not to be laught at upon any occasion; if a man be
in trade with them and the bargaine be almost strucke, if they
perceive you laugh, they will scarce proceed, supposing you
laugh because you have cheated them: the <i>Crocodiles</i> teares
may sooner deceive them, than the <i>Hienas</i> smiles: although
they be not much addicted to laughter, yet are they not of
a dumpish sad nature, but rather naturally chearefull: As I
never saw a gigling <i>Democrite</i>, so I never saw a teare dropping
<i>Heraclite</i>; no disaster being so prevalent as to open the
<span class='pageno' title='75' id='Page_75'></span>flood-gate of their eyes, saving the death of friends, for
whom they lament most exceedingly.</p>

    <div><i>Of their hardinesse.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>For their hardinesse it may procure admiration, no ordinary
paines making them so much as alter their countenance;
beate them, whip them, pinch them, punch them, if
they resolve not to whinch for it, they will not; whether it
be their benummed insensiblenesse of smart, or their hardie
resolutions, I cannot tell; It might be, a <i>Perillus</i> his Bull, or
the disjoynting racke might force a roare from them, but a
Turkish drubbing would not much molest them, and although
they be naturally much affraid of death, yet the unexpected
approach of a mortall wound by a Bullet, Arrow, or
Sword, strikes no more terrour, causes no more exclamation,
no more complaint, or whinching, than if it had beene a shot
into the body of a tree: such wounds as would be suddaine
death to an <i>English</i> man, would be nothing to them. Some
of them having beene shot in at the mouth, and out under the
eare, some shot in the breast, some runne thorough the
flankes with Darts, and other many desperate wounds
which eyther by their rare skill in the use of vegitatives, or
diabolicall charmes they cure in short time. Although their
hardinesse beare them out in such things wherein they are
sure death will not ensue, yet can it not expell the feare of
death, the very name and thoughts of it is so hideous to
them, or any thing that presents it, or threatens it, so terrible;
insomuch that a hundred of them will runne from two or
three Guns, though they know they can but dispatch two
or three at a discharge, yet every man fearing it may be his
lot to meete with his last, will not come neare that in good
earnest, which he dare play withall in jest. To make this
good by a passage of Experience. Three men having occasion
of trade amongst the Westerne <i>Indians</i>, went up with
some such commodities as they thought most fit for trade;
<span class='pageno' title='76' id='Page_76'></span>to secure their person they tooke a Carbine, two Pistoles
and a sword, which in outward shew was not great resistance
to a hundred well skilled bow men: The <i>Indians</i> hearing
their gunnes making a thundring noyse, desired to finger
one of them, &amp; see it discharged into a tree, wondring much
at the percussion of the bullet; but they abiding two or three
dayes, the gunnes were forgotten, and they began to looke
at the oddes being a hundred to three, whereupon they were
animated to worke treason against the lives of these men, and
to take away their goods from them by force; but one of
the <i>English</i> understanding their language, smelt out their
treachery, and being more fully informed of their intent by
the <i>Indian</i> women, who had more pitty, hee steps to their
King, and hailing him by the long haire from the rest of his
councell, commanded him either to goe before him and
guide him home, or else he would there kill him. The Sagamore
seeing him so rough, had not the courage to resist
him, but went with him two miles; but being exasperated
by his men who followed him along, to resist, and goe no
further; in the end hee would not, neither for faire promises
nor fierce threatnings, so that they were constrained there
to kill him, which struck such an amazement and daunting
into the rest of that naked crew, with the sight of the guns,
that though they might easily have killed them, yet had they
not the power to shoot an arrow, but followed them, yelling
and howling for the death of their King forty miles; his
goods being left among them, he sent word by other <i>Indians</i>,
that unlesse they sent him his goods againe, which hee
there left, hee would serve them as hee served their King,
whereupon they returned him his commodities, with intreaty
of peace, and promises of fairer trade if he came again.
If these heartlesse <i>Indians</i> were so cowed with so slender an
onset on their owne dunghill, when there were scarce six
families of ours in the Countrie, what need wee now feare
them being growne into thousands, and having knowledge
of martiall discipline? In the night they neede not to be feared,
for they will not budge from their owne dwellings for
feare of their <i>Abamacho</i> (the Devill) whom they much
<span class='pageno' title='77' id='Page_77'></span>feare, specially in evill enterprizes, they will rather lye by an
<i>English</i> fire than goe a quarter of a mile in the darke to their
owne dwellings: but they are well freed from this scarecrow
since the comming of the <i>English</i>, and lesse care for
his delusions; and whereas it hath beene reported, that there
are such horrible apparitions, fearefull roarings, thundering
and lightning raised by the Devill, to discourage the <i>English</i>
in their settling, I for mine owne part never saw or heard of
any of these things in the Countrie: nor have I heard of any
<i>Indians</i> that have lately beene put in feare, saving two or
three, and they worse scar'd than hurt, who seeing a Black-more
in the top of a tree, looking out for his way which he
had lost, surmised he was <i>Abamacho</i> or the Devill, deeming
all Devils that are blacker than themselves; and being
neare to the plantation, they posted to the <i>English</i>, intreated
their aide to conjure this Devill to his owne place, who
finding him to be a poore wandring Black-more, conducted
him to his Master.</p>

<div class="sh">
<i>Of their wondering at the first view of any strange
invention.</i>
</div>

<p class='c014'>These <i>Indians</i> being strangers to Arts and Sciences, and
being unacquainted with the inventions that are common
to a civilized people, are ravisht with admiration at the
first view of any such sight: They tooke the first Ship they
saw for a walking Iland, the Mast to be a Tree, the Saile
white Clouds, and the discharging of Ordinance for Lightning
and Thunder, which did much trouble them, but this
thunder being over, and this moving Iland stedied with an
Anchor, they manned out their cannowes to goe and picke
strawberries there, but being saluted by the way with a
broad side, they cried out, what much hoggery, so bigge
walke, and so bigge speake, and by and by kill; which caused
them to turne back, not daring to approach till they were
sent for. They doe much extoll and wonder at the <i>English</i>
<span class='pageno' title='78' id='Page_78'></span>for their strange Inventions, especially for a Wind-mill,
which in their esteeme was little lesse than the worlds wonder,
for the strangenesse of his whisking motion, and the
sharpe teeth biting the corne (as they terme it) into such
small peeces; they were loath at the first to come neere to
his long armes, or to abide in so tottering a tabernacle,
though now they dare goe any where so farre as they have
an <i>English</i> guide. The first plow-man was counted little
better than a luggler: the <i>Indians</i> seeing the plow teare up
more ground in a day, than their Clamme shels could scrape
up in a month, desired to see the workemanship of it, and
viewing well the coulter and share, perceiving it to be iron,
told the plow-man, hee was almost <i>Abamocho</i>, almost as
cunning as the Devill; but the fresh supplies of new and
strange objects hath lessen'd their admiration, and quickned
their inventions, and desire of practising such things as they
see, wherein they expresse no small ingenuitie, and dexterity
of wit, being neither furthered by art, or long experience.
It is thought they would soon learne any mechanicall trades,
having quicke wits, understanding apprehensions, strong
memories, with nimble inventions, and a quicke hand in
using of the Axe or Hatchet, or such like tooles: much good
might they receive from the <i>English</i>, and much might they
benefit themselves, if they were not strongly fettered in the
chaines of idlenesse; so as that they had rather starve than
worke, following no employments, saving such as are sweetned
with more pleasures and profit than paines or care, and
this is indeede one of the greatest accusations that can be
laid against them, which lies but upon the men, (the women
being very industrious) but it may be hoped that good example,
and good instructions may bring them to a more industrious
and provident course of life. For already, as they
have learned much subtiltie &amp; cunning by bargaining with
the <i>English</i>, so have they a little degenerated from some of
their lazie customes, and shew themselves more industrious.
In a word, to set them out in their best colours, they be wise
in their carriage, subtle in their dealings, true in their promise,
honest in defraying of their debts, though poverty
<span class='pageno' title='79' id='Page_79'></span>constraine them to be something long before; some having
died in the <i>English</i> debt, have left Beaver by order of Will
for their satisfaction: They be constant in friendship, merrily
conceited in discourse, not luxuriously abounding in youth,
nor dotingly froward in old age, many of them being much
civilized since the <i>English</i> Colonies were planted, though but
little edified in Religion: They frequent often the <i>English</i>
Churches, where they will sit soberly, though they understand
not such hidden mysteries. They doe easily beleeve
some of the History of the Bible, as the creation of the
World, the making of man, with his fall: but come to tell
them of a Saviour, with all the passages of the Gospell, and
it exceeds so farre their <i>Indian</i> beleefe, that they will cry out
(<i>Pocatnie</i>) <i>id est</i>, is it possible? yet such is their conviction
of the right way, that when some <i>English</i> have come to
their houses, victuals being offered them, forgetting to
crave Gods blessing upon the creatures received, they have
beene reproved by these, which formerly never knew what
calling upon God meant: thus farre for their naturall disposition
and qualities.</p>

    <div><i>Of their Kings government, and Subjects obedience.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Now for the matter of government amongst them: It is
the custome for their Kings to inherite, the sonne always
taking the Kingdome after his fathers death. If there be
no sonne, then the Queene rules; if no Queene, the next
to the blood-royall; who comes in otherwise, is but counted
an usurping intruder, and if his faire carriage beare him not
out the better, they will soone unscepter him.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Kings have no Lawes to command by, nor have they
any annuall revenewes; yet commonly are they so either feared
or beloved, that halfe their Subjects estate is at their Service,
and their persons at his command; by which command
he is better knowne than by any thing else. For though hee
hath no Kingly Robes, to make him glorious in the view of
his Subjects, nor dayly Guardes to secure his person, or
<span class='pageno' title='80' id='Page_80'></span>Court-like attendance, nor sumptuous Pallaces; yet doe they
yeeld all submissive subjection to him, accounting him their
Soveraigne; going at his command, and comming at his
becke, not so much as expostulating the cause, though it be
in matters thwarting their wills; he being accounted a disloyall
subject that will not effect what his Prince commands.
Whosoever is knowne to plot Treason, or to lay violent
hands on his lawfull King, is presently executed. Once a
yeare he takes his progresse, accompanied with a dozen of
his best Subjects to view his Countrey, to recreate himselfe,
and establish good order. When he enters into any of their
houses, without any more complement, he is desired to sit
downe on the ground; (for they use neither stooles nor cushions)
and after a little respite, all that be present, come in, and
sit downe by him, one of his Seniors pronouncing an Oration
gratulatory to his Majesty for his love; and the many good
things they enjoy under his peacefull government. A King of
large Dominions hath his Viceroyes, or inferiour Kings under
him, to agitate his State-affaires, and keepe his Subjects in
good decorum. Other Officers there be, but how to distinguish
them by name is some-thing difficult: For their Lawes,
as their evill courses come short of many other Nations, so
they have not so many Lawes, though they be not without
some, which they inflict upon notorious malefactors, as Traytors
to their Prince, inhumane murtherers, and some say for
adultery; but I cannot warrant it for a truth. For theft, as
they have nothing to steale worth the life of a man, therefore
they have no law to execute for trivialls; a Subject being precious
in the eye of his Prince, where men are so scarce. A
malefactor having deserved death, being apprehended, is
brought before the King, and some other of the wisest men
where they enquire out the originall of a thing; after proceeding
by aggravation of circumstances, he is found guilty,
and being cast by the Iury of their strict inquisition, he is condemned,
and executed on this manner: The Executioner
comes in, who blind-folds the party, sets him in the publike
view, and braines him with a <i>Tamahauke</i> or Club; which
done, his friends bury him. Other meanes to restraine abuses
<span class='pageno' title='81' id='Page_81'></span>they have none, saving admonition or reproofe; no whippings,
no Prisons, Stockes, Bilbowes, or the like.</p>

    <div><i>Of their Marriages.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Now to speake something of their Marriages, the Kings
or great <i>Powwowes</i>, <i>alias</i> Conjurers, may have two or
three Wives, but seldome use it. Men of ordinary Ranke, having
but one; which disproves the report, that they had
eight or tenne Wives apeece. When a man hath a desire to
Marry, he first gets the good-will of the Maide or Widdow,
after, the consent of her friends for her part; and for himselfe,
if he be at his owne disposing, if the King will, the match is
made, her Dowry of <i>Wampompeage</i> payd, the King joynes
their hands with their hearts, never to part till death, unlesse
Shee prove a Whore; for which they may, and some have put
away their Wives, as may appeare by a story. There was
one <i>Abamoch</i> married a Wife, whom a long time he intirely
loved above her deservings, for that shee often in his absence
entertained strangers, of which hee was oftentimes informed
by his neighbours, but hee harbouring no sparke of
jealousie, beleeved not their false informations (as he deemed
them) being in a manner angry they should slander his Wife,
of whose constancy hee was so strongly conceited: A long
time did her whorish gloazing and Syren-like tongue, with
her subtle carriage, establish her in her Husbands favour, till
fresh complaints caused him to cast about, how to finde out
the truth, and to prove his friends lyars, and his Wife honest,
or her a Whore, and his friends true: whereupon hee pretended
a long journey to visite his friends, providing all accoutraments
for a fortnights journey; telling his Wife it would
be so long before she could expect his returne, who outwardly
sorrowed for his departure, but inwardly rejoyced, that she
should enjoy the society of her old <i>Lemman</i>; whom she sent
for with expedition, not suspecting her Husbands plot, who
lay not many miles off in the Woods; who after their dishonest
<span class='pageno' title='82' id='Page_82'></span>revelings, when they were in their midnight sleepe,
approaches the Wiggwamme, enters the doore, which was
neither barred nor lockt; makes a light to discover what hee
little suspected; but finding his friends words to bee true,
hee takes a good bastinado in his hand brought for the same
purpose, dragging him by the haire from his usurped bed,
so lamentably beating him, that his battered bones and bruised
flesh made him a fitter subject for some skilfull Surgeon,
than the lovely obiect of a lustfull strumpet; which done,
hee put away his wife, exposing her to the curtesie of strangers
for her maintenance, that so curtesan-like had entertained
a stranger into her bosome.</p>

    <div><i>Of their worship, invocations, and conjurations.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Now of their worships: As it is naturall to all mortals
to worship something, so doe these people, but exactly
to describe to whom their worship is chiefly bent, is very
difficult; they acknowledge especially two, <i>Ketan</i> who is
their good God, to whom they sacrifice (as the ancient
Heathen did to <i>Ceres</i>) after their garners bee full with a
good croppe: upon this God likewise they invocate for
faire weather, for raine in time of drought, and for the recovery
of their sick; but if they doe not heare them, then
they verifie the old verse, <i>Flectere si nequeo Superos, Acharonta
movebo</i>, their Pow-wows betaking themselves to
their exorcismes and necromanticke charmes, by which
they bring to passe strange things, if wee may beleeve the
<i>Indians</i>, who report of one <i>Pissacannawa</i>, that hee can make
the water burne, the rocks move, the trees dance, metamorphize
himselfe into a flaming man. But it may be objected,
this is but <i>deceptio visus</i>. Hee will therefore doe more, for
in Winter, when there is no greene leaves to be got, he will
burne an old one to ashes, and putting those into the water,
produce a new greene leafe, which you shall not onely see,
but substantially handle and carrie away; and make of a dead
<span class='pageno' title='83' id='Page_83'></span>snakes skinne a living snake, both to be seene, felt, and heard;
this I write but upon the report of the <i>Indians</i>, who confidently
affirme stranger things. But to make manifest, that
by Gods permission, thorough the Devils helpe, their
charmes are of force to produce effects of wonderment;
An honest Gentle-man related a storie to mee, being an eye-witness
of the same: A Pow-wow having a patient with the
stumpe of some small tree runne thorough his foote, being
past the cure of his ordinary Surgery, betooke himselfe to
his charmes, and being willing to shew his miracle before
the <i>English</i> stranger, hee wrapt a piece of cloth about the
foote of the lame man; upon that wrapping a Beaver skinne,
through which hee laying his mouth to the Beaver skinne,
by his sucking charmes he brought out the stumpe, which he
spat into a tray of water, returning the foote as whole as its
fellow in a short time. The manner of their action in their
conjuration is thus: The parties that are sick or lame being
brought before them, the Pow-wow sitting downe, the rest
of the <i>Indians</i> giving attentive audience to his imprecations
and invocations, and after the violent expression of many a
hideous bellowing and groaning, he makes a stop, and then all
the auditors with one voice utter a short <i>Canto</i>; which
done, the Pow-wow still proceeds in his invocations, sometimes
roaring like a Beare, other times groaning like a dying
horse, foaming at the mouth like a chased bore, smiting on
his naked brest and thighs with such violence, as if he were
madde. Thus will hee continue sometimes halfe a day, spending
his lungs, sweating out his fat, and tormenting his body
in this diabolicall worship; sometimes the Devill for
requitall of their worship, recovers the partie, to nuzzle
them up in their divellish Religion. In former time hee was
wont to carrie away their wives and children, because hee
would drive them to these Martens, to fetch them again to
confirme their beliefe of this his much desired authoritie
over them: but since the <i>English</i> frequented those parts, they
daily fall from his colours, relinquishing their former fopperies,
and acknowledge our God to be supreame. They acknowledge

    <div><i>Of their Warres.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Of their Warres: Their old souldiers being swept away
by the Plague, which was very rife amongst them about
14 yeares agoe, and resting themselves secure under
the <i>English</i> protection, they doe not now practice any thing
in martiall feates worth observation, saving that they make
themselves Forts to flie into, if the enemies should unexpectedly
assaile them. These Forts some be fortie or fiftie foote
square, erected of young timber trees, ten or twelve foote
high, rammed into the ground, with undermining within, the
earth being cast up for their shelter against the dischargements
of their enemies, having loope-holes to send out their
winged messingers, which often deliver their sharpe and
bloody embassies in the tawnie sides of their naked assailants,
who wanting butting Rammes and battering Ordinances to
command at distance, lose their lives by their too neare approachments.
These use no other weapons in warre than
bowes and arrowes, saving that their Captaines have long
speares, on which if they returne conquerours they carrie
the heads of their chiefe enemies that they slay in the wars:
it being the custome to cut off their heads, hands, and feete,
to beare home to their wives and children, as true tokens of
their renowned victorie. When they goe to their warres,
it is their custome to paint their faces with diversitie of colours,
some being all black as jet, some red, some halfe red
<span class='pageno' title='85' id='Page_85'></span>and halfe blacke, some blacke and white, others spotted
with divers kinds of colours, being all disguised to their enemies,
to make them more terrible to their foes, putting on
likewise their rich Iewels, pendents and Wampompeage, to
put them in minde they fight not onely for their Children,
Wives, and lives, but likewise for their goods, lands and liberties;
Being thus armed with this warlike paint, the antique
warriers make towards their enemies in a disordered
manner, without any souldier like marching or warlike postures,
being deafe to any word of command, ignorant of
falling off, or falling on, of doubling rankes or files, but let
fly their winged shaftments without eyther feare or wit;
their Artillery being spent, he that hath no armes to fight,
findes legges to run away.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><i>Their games and sports of activitie.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Bvt to leave their warres, and to speake of their games
in which they are more delighted and better experienced,
spending halfe their dayes in gaming and lazing. They
have two sorts of games, one called <i>Puim</i>, the other <i>Hubbub</i>,
not much unlike Cards and Dice, being no other than
Lotterie. <i>Puim</i> is 50. or 60. small Bents of a foote long
which they divide to the number of their gamesters, shuffling
them first betweene the palmes of their hands; he that
hath more than his fellow is so much the forwarder in his
game: many other strange whimseyes be in this game;
which would be too long to commit to paper; hee that is
a noted gamster, hath a great hole in his eare wherein hee
carries his <i>Puims</i> in defiance of his antagonists. <i>Hubbub</i> is
five small Bones in a small smooth Tray, the bones bee
like a Die, but something flatter, blacke on the one side and
white on the other, which they place on the ground, against
which violently thumping the platter, the bones mount
changing colours with the windy whisking of their hands
too and fro; which action in that sport they much use, smiting
themselves on the breast, and thighs, crying out, <i>Hub,
<span class='pageno' title='86' id='Page_86'></span>Hub, Hub</i>; they may be heard play at this game a quarter
of a mile off. The bones being all blacke or white, make a
double game; if three be of a colour and two of another,
then they affoard but a single game; foure of a colour and
one differing is nothing; so long as a man winns, he keepes
the Tray: but if he loose, the next man takes it. They are
so bewitched with these two games, that they will loose
sometimes all they have, Beaver, Moose-skinnes, Kettles,
Wampompeage, Mowhackies, Hatchets, Knives, all is confiscate
by these two games. For their sports of activitie
they have commonly but three or foure; as footeball,
shooting, running and swimming: when they play country
against country, there are rich Goales, all behung with
Wampompeage, Mowhackies, Beaver skins, and blacke Otter
skinnes. It would exceede the beleefe of many to relate
the worth of one Goale, wherefore it shall be namelesse.
Their Goales be a mile long placed on the sands, which are
as even as a board; their ball is no bigger than a hand-ball,
which sometimes they mount in the Aire with their naked
feete, sometimes it is swayed by the multitude; sometimes
also it is two dayes before they get a Goale, then
they marke the ground they winne, and beginne there
the next day. Before they come to this sport, they paint
themselves, even as when they goe to warre, in pollicie to
prevent future mischiefe, because no man should know him
that moved his patience or accidentally hurt his person, taking
away the occasion of studying revenge. Before they
begin their armes be disordered, and hung upon some neighbouring
tree, after which they make a long scrowle on the
sand, over which they shake loving hands, and with laughing
hearts scuffle for victorie. While the men play the
boyes pipe, and the women dance and sing trophies of their
husbands conquests; all being done a feast summons their
departure. It is most delight to see them play, in smaller
companies, when men may view their swift footemanship,
their curious tossings of their Ball, their flouncing into the
water, their lubberlike wrestling, having no cunning at all
in that kind, one <i>English</i> being able to beate ten <i>Indians</i> at
<span class='pageno' title='87' id='Page_87'></span>footeball. For their shooting they be most desperate marksmen
for a point blancke object, and if it may bee possible
<i>Cornicum oculos configere</i> they will doe it: such is their celerity
and dexterity in Artillerie, that they can smite the
swift running Hinde and nimble winged Pigeon without a
standing pause or left eyed blinking; they draw their Arrowes
between the fore fingers and the thumbe; their bowes
be quicke, but not very strong, not killing above six or seaven
score. These men shoot at one another, but with swift
conveighance shunne the Arrow; this they doe to make them
expert against time of warre. It hath beene often admired
how they can finde their Arrowes, be the weedes as high as
themselves, yet they take such perfect notice of the flight
and fall that they seldome loose any. They are trained up
to their bowes even from their childhood; little boyes
with Bowes made of little stickes and Arrowes of great
bents, will smite downe a peece of Tobacco pipe every shoot
a good way off: as these <i>Indians</i> be good marksmen, so are
they well experienced where the very life of every creature
lyeth, and know where to smite him to make him dye presently.
For their swimming it is almost naturall, but much
perfected by continuall practise; their swimming is not after
our <i>English</i> fashion of spread armes and legges which
they hold too tiresome, but like dogges their armes before
them cutting through the liquids with their right shoulder;
in this manner they swimme very swift and farre, either in
rough or smooth waters, sometimes for their ease lying as
still as a log; sometimes they will play the dive-doppers,
and come up in unexpected places. Their children likewise
be taught to swimme when they are very young. For their
running it is with much celeritie and continuance, yet I suppose
there be many <i>English</i> men who being as lightly clad
as they are, would outrun them for a spurt, though not able
to continue it for a day or dayes, being they be very strong
winded and rightly clad for a race.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><i>Of their huntings.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>For their hunting, it is to be noted that they have no swift
foote Grayhounds, to let slippe at the sight of the Deere,
no deepe mouthed hounds, or senting beagles, to finde out
their desired prey; themselves are all this, who in that time of
the yeare, when the Deere comes downe, having certaine
hunting houses, in such places where they know the Deere
usually doth frequent, in which they keep their randevowes,
their snares and all their accoutraments for that imployment:
when they get sight of a Deere, Moose or Beare, they
studie how to get the wind of him, and approaching within
shot, stab their marke quite through, if the bones hinder not.
The chiefe thing they hunt after is Deere, Mooses, and Beares,
it greeves them more to see an <i>English</i> man take one Deere,
than a thousand Acres of land: they hunt likewise after
Wolves, and wild Catts, Rackoones, Otters, Beavers, Musquashes,
trading both their skinnes and flesh to the <i>English</i>.
Besides their artillery, they have other devices to kill their
game, as sometimes hedges a mile or two miles long, being
a mile wide at one end, and made narrower and narrower by
degrees, leaving onely a gap of sixe foote long, over against
which, in the day time they lye lurking to shoot the Deere
which come through that narrow gut; so many as come
within the circumference of that hedge, seldome returne
backe to leape over, unlesse they be forced by the chasing
of some ravenous Wolfe, or sight of some accidentall passinger;
in the night at the gut of this hedge, they set Deere
traps, which are springes made of young trees, and smooth
wrought coards; so strong as it will tosse a horse if hee be
caught in it. An <i>English</i> Mare being strayed from her owner,
and growne wild by her long sojourning in the Woods
ranging up and downe with the wilde crew, stumbled into
one of these traps which stopt her speed, hanging her like
<i>Mahomets</i> tombe, betwixt earth, and heaven; the morning
being come, the <i>Indians</i> went to looke what good successe
their Venison trappes brought them, but seeing such a
<span class='pageno' title='89' id='Page_89'></span>long scutted Deere, praunce in their Merritotter, they bade
her good morrow, crying out, what cheere what cheere
<i>Englishmans squaw</i> horse; having no better epithite than to
call her a woman horse, but being loath to kill her, and as
fearefull to approach neere the friscadoes of her Iron
heeles, they posted to the <i>English</i> to tell them how the case
stood or hung with their <i>squaw</i> horse, who unhorsed their
Mare, and brought her to her former tamenesse, which since
hath brought many a good foale, and performed much good
service. In these traps Deeres, Mooses, Beares, Wolves, Catts,
and Foxes, are often caught. For their Beavers and Otters,
they have other kinde of trappes, so ponderous as is unsupportable
for such creatures, the massie burthen whereof either
takes them prisoners, or expells their breath from their
squised bodyes. These kinde of creatures would gnaw the
other kind of trappes asunder, with their sharpe teeth: these
beasts are too cunning for the <i>English</i>, who seldome or never
catch any of them, therefore we leave them to those skilfull
hunters whose time is not so precious, whose experience
bought-skill hath made them practicall and usefull in that
particuler.</p>

<p class='c014'>Of their fishing, in this trade they be very expert, being
experienced in the knowledge of all baites, fitting sundry
baites for severall fishes, and diverse seasons; being not
ignorant likewise of the removall of fishes, knowing when
to fish in rivers, and when at rockes, when in Baies, and
when at Seas: since the <i>English</i> came they be furnished
with <i>English</i> hookes and lines, before they made them of
their owne hempe more curiously wrought, of stronger
materials than ours, hooked with bone hookes: but lazinesse
drives them to buy more than profit or commendations
winnes them to make of their owne; they make likewise very
strong Sturgeon nets with which they catch Sturgeons of
12. 14. and 16. some 18. foote long in the day time, in the
<span class='pageno' title='90' id='Page_90'></span>night time they betake them to their Burtchen <i>Cannows</i>, in
which they carry a forty fathome line, with a sharpe bearded
dart, fastned at the end thereof; then lightning a blazing
torch made of Burtchen rindes, they weave it too and againe
by their <i>Cannow</i> side, which the Sturgeon much delighted
with, comes to them tumbling and playing, turning up
his white belly, into which they thrust their launce, his
backe being impenetrable; which done they haile to the
shore their strugling prize. They have often recourse unto
the rockes whereupon the sea beates, in warme weather to
looke out for sleepie Seales, whose oyle they much esteeme,
using it for divers things. In summer they seldome fish any
where but in salt, in winter in the fresh water and ponds; in
frostie weather they cut round holes in the yce, about
which they wil sit like so many apes, on their naked breeches
upon the congealed yce, catching of Pikes, Pearches,
Breames, and other sorts of fresh water fish.</p>

<p class='c014'>Of their severall Arts and imployments, as first in dressing
of all manner of skinnes, which they doe by scraping
and rubbing, afterwards painting them with antique
embroyderings in unchangeable colours, sometimes they
take off the haire, especially if it bee not killed in season.
Their bowes they make of a handsome shape, strung commonly
with the sinnewes of Mooses; their arrowes are made
of young Elderne, feathered with feathers of Eagles wings
and tailes, headed with brasse in shape of a heart or triangle,
fastned in a slender peece of wood sixe or 8 inches long,
which is framed to put loose in the pithie Elderne, that is
bound fast for riving: their arrowes be made in this manner
because the arrow might shake from his head and be left behind
for their finding, and the pile onely remaine to gaule
the wounded beast. Their cordage is so even, soft, and
smooth, that it lookes more like silke than hempe; their Sturgeon
netts be not deepe, nor above 30. or 40. foote long,
<span class='pageno' title='91' id='Page_91'></span>which in ebbing low waters they stake fast to the ground,
where they are sure the Sturgeon will come, never looking
more at it, till the next low water. Their <i>Cannows</i> be made either
of Pine-trees, which before they were acquainted with
<i>English</i> tooles, they burned hollow, scraping them smooth
with Clam-shels and Oyster-shels, cutting their out-sides with
stone-hatchets: These Boates be not above a foot and a halfe,
or two feete wide, and twenty foote long. Their other <i>Cannows</i>
be made of thinne Birch-rines, close-ribbed on the in-side
with broad thinne hoopes, like the hoopes of a Tub; these are
made very light, a man may carry one of them a mile, being
made purposely to carry from River to River, and Bay to Bay,
to shorten Land-passages. In these cockling fly-boates, wherein
an <i>English</i> man can scarce sit without a fearefull tottering,
they will venture to Sea, when an <i>English</i> Shallope dare not
beare a knot of sayle; scudding over the overgrowne waves as
fast as a winde-driven Ship, being driven by their padles; being
much like battle doores; if a crosse wave (as is seldome)
turne her keele up-side downe, they by swimming free her, and
scramble into her againe.</p>

    <div><i>Of their Language.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Of their Language which is onely peculiar to themselves,
not inclining to any of the refined tongues. Some have
thought they might be of the dispersed <i>Iewes</i>, because some of
their words be neare unto the <i>Hebrew</i>; but by the same rule
they may conclude them to be some of the gleanings of all Nations,
because they have words which sound after the <i>Greeke</i>,
<i>Latine</i>, <i>French</i>, and other tongues: Their Language is hard
to learne; few of the <i>English</i> being able to speake any of it, or
capable of the right pronunciation, which is the chiefe grace
of their tongue. They pronounce much after the Diphthongs,
excluding <i>L</i> and <i>R</i>, which in our <i>English</i> Tongue they pronounce
with as much difficulty, as most of the <i>Dutch</i> doe <i>T</i>
and <i>H</i>, calling a Lobster a <i>Nobstann</i>. Every Countrey
<span class='pageno' title='92' id='Page_92'></span>doth something differ in their Speech, even as our Northerne
people doe from the Southerne, and Westerne from them;
especially the <i>Tarrenteens</i>, whose Tongues runne so much upon
<i>R</i>, that they wharle much in pronunciation. When any
ships come neare the shore, they demand whether they be
King <i>Charles</i> his <i>Torries</i>, with such a rumbling sound, as if
one were beating an unbrac't Drumme. In serious discourse
our Southerne <i>Indians</i> use seldome any short <i>Colloquiums</i>,
but speake their minds at large, without any interjected interruptions
from any: The rest giving diligent audience to his
utterance; which done, some or other returnes him as long
an answere, they love not to speake <i>multa sed multum</i>, seldome
are their words, and their deeds strangers. According
to the matter in discourse, so are their acting gestures in their
expressions. One of the <i>English</i> Preachers in a speciall good
intent of doing good to their soules, hath spent much time in
attaining to their Language, wherein he is so good a proficient,
that he can speake to their understanding, and they to
his; much loving and respecting him for his love and counsell.
It is hoped that he may be an instrument of good amongst
them. They love any man that can utter his minde in their
words, yet are they not a little proud that they can speake
the <i>English</i> tongue, using it as much as their owne, when
they meete with such as can understand it, puzling stranger
<i>Indians</i>, which sometimes visite them from more remote places,
with an unheard language.</p>

health-wasting diseases which are incident to other Countries,

concerning which their <i>Indian</i> faith jumps much with
the <i>Turkish Alchoran</i>, holding it to be a kinde of Paradise,
wherein they shall everlastingly abide, solacing themselves in
odoriferous Gardens, fruitfull Corne-fields, greene Medows,
bathing their tawny hides in the coole streames of pleasant Rivers,
and shelter themselves from heate and cold in the sumptuous
Pallaces framed by the skill of Natures curious contrivement;
concluding that neither care nor paine shall molest them,
but that Natures bounty will administer all things with a voluntary
contribution from the overflowing store-house of
their <i>Elyzian</i> Hospitall, at the portall whereof they say, lies
a great Dogge, whose churlish snarlings deny a <i>Pax intrantibus</i>,
to unworthy intruders: Wherefore it is their custome,
to bury with them their Bows and Arrows, and good store of
their <i>Wampompeage</i> and <i>Mowhackies</i>; the one to affright that

<i>Of their women, their dispositions, employments, usage by
their husbands, their apparell, and modesty.</i>
</div>

<p class='c014'>To satisfie the curious eye of women-readers, who otherwise
might thinke their sex forgotten, or not worthy
a record, let them peruse these few lines, wherein they
may see their owne happinesse, if weighed in the womans
ballance of these ruder <i>Indians</i>, who scorne the tuterings of
their wives, or to admit them as their equals, though their
qualities and industrious deservings may justly claime the
preheminence, and command better usage and more conjugall
esteeme, their persons and features being every way correspondent,
their qualifications more excellent, being more
loving, pittifull, and modest, milde, provident, and laborious
than their lazie husbands. Their employments be many: First
their building of houses, whose frames are formed like our
garden-arbours, something more round, very strong and
handsome, covered with close-wrought mats of their owne
weaving, which deny entrance to any drop of raine, though
it come both fierce and long, neither can the piercing North
winde finde a crannie, through which he can conveigh his
cooling breath, they be warmer than our <i>English</i> houses; at
the top is a square hole for the smoakes evacuation, which
in rainy weather is covered with a pluver; these bee such
smoakie dwellings, that when there is good fires, they are
not able to stand upright, but lie all along under the smoake,
never using any stooles or chaires, it being as rare to see an
<i>Indian</i> sit on a stoole at home, as it is strange to see an <i>English</i>
man sit on his heeles abroad. Their houses are smaller
in the Summer, when their families be dispersed, by reason
of heate and occasions. In Winter they make some fiftie or
threescore foote long, fortie or fiftie men being inmates under
one roofe; and as is their husbands occasion these poore
tectonists are often troubled like snailes, to carrie their houses
on their backs sometime to fishing-places, other times to
hunting-places, after that to a planting place, where it abides
<span class='pageno' title='95' id='Page_95'></span>the longest: an other work is their planting of corne, wherein
they exceede our <i>English</i> husband-men, keeping it so
cleare with their Clamme shell-hooes, as if it were a garden
rather than a corne-field, not suffering a choaking weede to
advance his audacious head above their infant corne, or an
undermining worme to spoile his spurnes. Their corne
being ripe, they gather it, and drying it hard in the Sunne,
conveigh it to their barnes, which be great holes digged in
the ground in forme of a brasse pot, seeled with rinds of
trees, wherein they put their corne, covering it from the
inquisitive search of their gurmandizing husbands, who
would eate up both their allowed portion, and reserved
feede, if they knew where to finde it. But our hogges having
found a way to unhindge their barne doores, and robbe
their garners, they are glad to implore their husbands helpe
to roule the bodies of trees over their holes, to prevent
those pioners, whose theeverie they as much hate as their
flesh. An other of their employments is their Summer processions
to get Lobsters for their husbands, wherewith they
baite their hookes when they goe a fishing for Basse or Codfish.
This is an every dayes walke, be the weather cold or
hot, the waters rough or calme, they must dive sometimes
over head and eares for a Lobster, which often shakes them
by their hands with a churlish nippe, and bids them adiew.
The tide being spent, they trudge home two or three miles,
with a hundred weight of Lobsters at their backs, and if
none, a hundred scoules meete them at home, and a hungry
belly for two dayes after. Their husbands having caught any
fish, they bring it in their boates as farre as they can by
water, and there leave it; as it was their care to catch it, so
it must be their wives paines to fetch it home, or fast: which
done, they must dresse it and cooke it, dish it, and present it,
see it eaten over their shoulders; and their loggerships having
filled their paunches, their sweete lullabies scramble
for their scrappes. In the Summer these <i>Indian</i> women when
Lobsters be in their plenty and prime, they drie them to
keepe for Winter, erecting scaffolds in the hot sun-shine,
making fires likewise underneath them, by whose smoake
<span class='pageno' title='96' id='Page_96'></span>the flies are expelled, till the substance remain hard and drie.
In this manner they drie Basse and other fishes without salt,
cutting them very thinne to dry suddainely, before the flies
spoile them, or the raine moist them, having a speciall care
to hang them in their smoakie houses, in the night and dankish
weather.</p>

<p class='c005'>In Summer they gather flagges, of which they make Matts
for houses, and Hempe and Rushes, with dying stuffe of
which they make curious baskets with intermixed colours
and portractures of antique Imagerie: these baskets be
of all sizes from a quart to a quarter, in which they carry
their luggage. In winter time they are their husbands Caterers,
trudging to the Clamm bankes for their belly timber,
and their Porters to lugge home their Venison which their
lazinesse exposes to the Woolves till they impose it upon
their wives shoulders. They likewise sew their husbands
shooes, and weave coates of Turkie feathers, besides all their
ordinary household drudgerie which daily lies upon them,
so that a bigge bellie hinders no businesse, nor a childebirth
takes much time, but the young Infant being greased and
sooted, wrapt in a Beaver skin, bound to his good behaviour
with his feete up to his bumme, upon a board two foote
long and one foot broade, his face exposed to all nipping
weather; this little <i>Pappouse</i> travells about with his bare
footed mother to paddle in the Icie Clammbankes after
three or foure dayes of age have sealed his passeboard and
his mothers recoverie. For their carriage it is very civill,
smiles being the greatest grace of their mirth; their musick
is lullabies to quiet their children, who generally are as
quiet as if they had neither spleene or lungs. To heare one
of these <i>Indians</i> unseene, a good eare might easily mistake
their untaught voyce for the warbling of a well tuned instrument.
Such command have they of their voices. These
womens modesty drives them to weare more cloathes than
their men, having alwayes a coate of cloath or skinnes
wrapt like a blanket about their loynes, reaching downe to
their hammes which they never put off in company. If a
husband have a minde to sell his wives Beaver petticote, as
<span class='pageno' title='97' id='Page_97'></span>sometimes he doth, shee will not put it off untill shee have
another to put on: commendable is their milde carriage and
obedience to their husbands, notwithstanding all this their
customarie churlishnesse and savage inhumanitie, not seeming
to delight in frownes or offering to word it with their
lords, not presuming to proclaime their female superiority
to the usurping of the least title of their husbands charter, but
rest themselves content under their helplesse condition, counting
it the womans portion: since the <i>English</i> arrivall comparison
hath made them miserable, for seeing the kind usage
of the <i>English</i> to their wives, they doe as much condemne
their husbands for unkindnesse, and commend the <i>English</i>
for their love. As their husbands commending themselves
for their wit in keeping their wives industrious, doe condemne
the <i>English</i> for their folly in spoyling good working
creatures. These women resort often to the <i>English</i> houses,
where <i>pares cum paribus congregatæ</i>, in Sex I meane, they do
somewhat ease their miserie by complaining and seldome
part without a releefe: If her husband come to seeke for
his <i>Squaw</i> and beginne to bluster, the <i>English</i> woman betakes
her to her armes which are the warlike Ladle, and the
scalding liquors, threatning blistering to the naked runnaway,
who is soone expelled by such liquid comminations. In
a word to conclude this womans historie, their love to the
<i>English</i> hath deserved no small esteeme, ever presenting
them some thing that is either rare or desired, as Strawberries,
Hurtleberries, Rasberries, Gooseberries, Cherries,
Plummes, Fish, and other such gifts as their poore treasury
yeelds them. But now it may be, that this relation of the
churlish and inhumane behaviour of these ruder <i>Indians</i>
towards their patient wives, may confirme some in the beliefe
of an aspersion, which I have often heard men cast upon
the <i>English</i> there, as if they should learne of the <i>Indians</i>
to use their wives in the like manner, and to bring them to
the same subjection, as to sit on the lower hand, and to carrie
water, and the like drudgerie: but if my owne experience
may out-ballance an ill-grounded scandalous rumour, I doe
assure you, upon my credit and reputation, that there is no
<span class='pageno' title='98' id='Page_98'></span>such matter, but the women finde there as much love, respect,
and ease, as here in old <i>England</i>. I will not deny, but
that some poore people may carrie their owne water, and
doe not the poorer sort in <i>England</i> doe the same, witnesse
your <i>London</i> Tankerd-bearers, and your countrie-cottagers?
But this may well be knowne to be nothing, but the rancorous
venome of some that beare no good will to the plantation.
For what neede they carrie water, seeing every one
hath a Spring at his doore, or the Sea by his house? Thus
much for the satisfaction of women, touching this entrenchment
upon their prerogative, as also
concerning the relation of these
<i>Indian</i> Squawes.</p>
